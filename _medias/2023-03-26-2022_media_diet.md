  A recap of the books, movies, and performances that I experienced in 2022.

It was a significantly lighter year than usual in terms of book consumption. Some of this was a hectic travel schedule the first half of year and moving to California in the second half; some of this seems to have been starting (and not finishing) more books than usual.

2023 is off to a stronger start, though the relentless AI news does vie for attention.

Always looking for thoughtful recommendations.
