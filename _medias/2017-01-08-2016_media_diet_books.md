  Quick recaps of the books I read in 2016.
---

When I posted the list of books I read in [2015](https://smflem.github.io/2016/01/10/2015_media_diet.html), a few people asked for something in the way of description / opinion to give a bit more color to the list.

While you can see the full 2016 list [here](https://smflem.github.io/2017/01/08/2016_media_diet.html), this is the expanded version focusing on books.

Always looking for thoughtful recommendations.

# **Books**
*Book title* - Author (Recommended by)

<br>
*Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital* - Carlota Perez

Interesting look at the interaction of herding / bubbles in the financing of technological change. The thesis is that overspending in the bubble phase creates socially useful residual value, but some of the recent experiences of 'Uber for X' type businesses and the duplication of infrastructure show that significant value destruction is still possible even if there are net benefits of the phenomenon in aggregate. Book is kind of expensive but is available in the Robarts Stacks at U of T.

<br>
*Red Notice* - Bill Browder (Christal Wang)

Fast paced, engaging but ultimately shallow read about investing in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and in the emerging oligarchic era from the perspective of one fund manager, who has some nasty run-ins with said oligarchs.

<br>
*Barbarians at the Gate* - Bryan Burrough and John Helyar

For 95% of people, watching [the movie](https://youtu.be/iPhF_YwWvoM) is the better option unless you relish a very detailed blow by blow of a decades old deal. For those really pressed for time, just watch the 2 minutes starting at 15:55 in the linked video.

*"Debt can be an asset. Debt tightens a company"*

<br>
*Strategic Logic* - Carlos Jarillo (Jeff Fong)

This book is 50% Jarillo trash-talking the state of business thinking and 50% insight, which actually isn't terrible given that most business books don't even have 10% of the latter. Focus is on the correct level of aggregation when analyzing a competitive unit, as well as the true drivers of competitive advantage in the market.

<br>
*Certain to Win* - Chet Richards

Boyd-ian theory adapted to the world of business. If that doesn't mean anything to you, read Tempo by Venkatesh Rao first / instead which explores a wider set of ideas. Otherwise a useful expansion and articulation of some of Boyd's core ideas in a longer format.

<br>
*Financialization and Strategy* - Julie Froud

Interesting look at how the maturation of capital markets have affected decision making within large corporations, especially when it comes to data and measurement. Would contrast / pair well with '[Overpowered metrics eat underspecified goals](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/29/soft-bias-of-underspecified-goals/)'.

<br>
*Red Plenty* - Francis Spufford ([Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-03-04/unicorns-aren-t-so-beloved-by-investors-anymore))

This is a wonderful book, read it.

An exploration of the earnest optimism around the planned economy in the post-war Soviet Union, and it's erosion and degradation into the failed state that ultimately collapsed in 1991. The language is beautiful, the characters vivid and the optimistic yearning for a better life is heartbreaking in it's earnestness.

Highlights include an unforgettable scene set on a lakeshore in the moonlight (best paired with *Blue in Green* as in the book), and the most vivid description of someone getting cancer that I've ever come across.

<br>
*Shop Class as Soulcraft* - Matthew Crawford

A thought provoking read for someone that spends so many hours of life sitting in front of a computer in an office. Book could be a bit shorter / tighter, but still worthwhile.

<br>
*Slowness* - Milan Kundera

A vivid book in Kundera's style that mixes the ridiculous with the profound. Worth reading.

<br>
*Taipei* - Tao Lin (Davis Austerberry)

Lin’s minute examination of the everyday (drug-addled) life feels like something David Foster Wallace might write, but without the overarching vision or exploration of universal ideas that give the latter’s work some meaning. Still, may be worth working through for some.

<br>
*Norwegian Wood* - Haruki Murakami (Claire Eagle / Olivia Chen)

This was my first Murakami, and it's a bit flat relative to his other work. In all his works, I really appreciate his use of music in bringing a scene alive, along with his many references to cooking and eating. This story is no exception.

Incidentally, watching a building burn down is probably an underrated first date idea, though hard to reliably replicate.

<br>
*Steppenwolf* - Hermann Hess

I re-read this classic when a friend was struggling to get through the beginning. I've recommended this book to a couple people now, and while some respond really positively, many struggle to get through the first 1/2 of the book, which can be quite depressing in spots. The payoff is at the very end of the book, but I think it's worth the work.

<br>
*The Argonauts* - Maggie Nelson (Olivia Chen)

This is a wonderful story exploring identity, family and love. The prose and characters are vivid, alive in a way that few other author's manage.
The phrase 'stack of cocks' is not the most graphic thing appearing in the opening paragraph; this is not really one for the kids.
The only book that made me cry this year.

<br>
*Maus* - Art Spiegalman (Olivia Chen)

A graphic novel depicting the Jewish experience in the period before and during WWII, along with the author's relationship with his father. Moving and funny. The first graphic novel to win a Pulitzer.

<br>
*The Fountainhead* - Ayn Rand (Luke Riley)

Odds are you've heard of this book but never read it. This is shorter and tighter than Atlas Shrugged, but you could probably still injure someone with a physical copy. Thankfully, it is also mostly bereft of 80 page speeches.
Pretty standard competence porn, which seems to drive Rand's continued popularity despite the flaws. Provides a distinct perspective on the nature of vision, competence and creation in the face of wider social resistance. Also an interesting take on the 'power' of media organizations given some of what's happened in the US over the last year.

Despite the seeming politicization of Rand's work, should not be taken as gospel nor dismissed out of hand.

<br>
*The Defining Decade* - Meg Jay (Davis Austerberry)

Basic premise is that your 20's are important and shouldn't be wasted under the false assumption that '30 is the new 20'. Not exactly a message I urgently needed in order to turn my life around, but I can see how this could be a very useful perspective for others.

<br>
*1Q84* - Haruki Murakami (Jessica Zhang)

Really strong opening scene but ultimately struggles to live up to it's grand promise. That said, still a lovely book that showcases Murakami's knack for writing odd, surreal but believable characters.

Janacek's Sinfonietta plays a recurring role in the story and I listened to it quite a bit while reading 1Q84, but I'm not sure it quite fits. The music seems to actually achieve the mixed feeling of whimsy and seriousness that Murakami was trying for, but that he ultimately struggled to capture in prose.
Maybe worth reading, but read Kafka on the Shore first.

<br>
*5 Dysfunctions of a Team* - Patrick Lencioni

Recommended to me by someone at a conference years ago, this short book is a useful frame with which to think about healthy vs. unhealthy teams, and the behaviours required to create the former.

<br>
*The Emperor's Revenge* - Clive Cussler

Pretty standard popcorn fare. Enjoyable but not particularly memorable.

<br>
*4-Hour Chef* - Tim Ferriss

2017 is the year I spend time practicing cooking, after cooking <10 meals last year.

I liked this book for it's focus on learning as a process that can be optimized and, from a cooking perspective, its focus on the building blocks to be learned for competence rather than just recipes to be followed.

<br>
*Emperor of All Maladies* - Siddhartha Mukherjee (Janelle Tam)

A well-written and engaging 'biography of cancer'. Maybe it's my lack of grounding in biology or medicine, but my biggest takeaways were around how groups of people accept or reject new ideas, and how the mental models and metaphors used to think about things can drive serious damage if they're incorrect or misaligned with reality.

<br>
*A is for Alibi* - Sue Grafton (Kinsey Powell)

Enjoyable crime / detective novel with a strong female lead character. Also a bit of a throwback since it's set in Santa Barbara in the 80's

<br>
*Kafka on the Shore* - Haruki Murakami (Jessica Zhang)

This story feels like the better, tighter version of 1Q84, though that book was released 7 years after Kafka on the Shore.

There is a character that looks like the Johnnie Walker logo and has a flute made out of cat's souls. There is a prostitute that quotes Hegel. Leeches fall from the sky. Worthwhile.

<br>
*[Folding Beijing](http://uncannymagazine.com/article/folding-beijing-2/)* - Hao Jingfang

My second round of economic fiction, this short story is set in a futuristic Beijing that is literally divided by social class with access to daylight and even wakeful time apportioned based on wealth and power.
