My name is Sean Fleming, and I currently [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smflem) as a strategy consultant based in Toronto.

In the past decade I've also been fortunate enough to live in Vancouver, northern Virginia, and New York, and work temporarily in Calgary, Montreal, Ann Arbor, and Boulder (among others). I grew up north of Los Angeles. I hold a BCom from the University of British Columbia and an MBA from Columbia Business School.

My professional interests include:
- Climate change (especially the energy transition)
- Technology (especially where it moves the possibility frontier outward)
- Strategy (especially as it interacts with organizational capacity)

That said, over the years my work has ranged across topics as disparate as growth strategy for milk, performance improvement for underground gold mines, charter school operations in Washington DC, and much more besides.

Because this is a personal site, there's also stuff related to musical theatre, cycling, and what movies I happened to watch in a given year.

All opinions and errors within are my own.<br>
Nothing here should be taken to represent any of my past, present, or future employers, clients, etc.

This site is currently built using Jekyll based on the [Alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic) theme by David Darnes. It is served via Github Pages.
