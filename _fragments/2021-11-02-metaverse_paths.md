Last week, Mark Zuckerberg [outlined](https://www.facebookconnect.com/en-us/session/70f2a060-08ef-4aba-a500-3c0495e5519a/) his grand ambition to build the infrastructure of the metaverse, committing himself and the company formerly known as Facebook to a long-term bet on building a particular vision of the future of social technology. The video was slick, and laid out not just the near-term products that Meta is focusing on, but the long-term principles by which Meta hopes to help build the infrastructure for the metaverse.

Later in the week, John Carmack (Consulting CTO at Oculus) also had a [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnSUk0je6oo) (Carmack's notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ruv739914jzquue/connect2021.txt?dl=0)). It included the phrase 'architecture astronauts', and was reported on by a [number](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/john-carmack-sounds-a-skeptical-note-over-metas-metaverse-plans/) of [outlets](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-10-29-oculus-john-carmack-skeptical-about-efforts-to-build-the-metaverse) as "skeptical" of the plans laid out by Zuckerberg.

But the skepticism lay primarily in the 'how', rather than the 'what' of the end vision.

Carmack said as much:

>"I buy into the vision...[but] I have pretty good reasons to believe that setting out to build the metaverse is not actually the best way to wind up with the metaverse."

Carmack's note that "If you aren't using it, it probably doesn't work" stands in tension with Zuckerberg's assertion that products alone won't be enough to get to the metaverse vision, and that direct focus on the ecosystem would be critical.

At heart, the point of friction seems to lie in [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)):

>"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. you have to start over with a working simple system."

It remains to be seen whether Meta ends up building misguided or unworkable infrastructure for lack of a grounding in actual use, but the existence of the Carmack keynote implies that Meta is giving space for both sides of the argument and at least recognizes the risks here.

Other notes from the keynotes:
- The focus on mutual presence makes sense in the context of Zuckerberg's focus on fostering connection, and could mean interesting things for the possibilities of VR. I've written [elsewhere](https://smflem.github.io/2021/06/21/theatre_elements) about the importance that mutual presence has in the experience of live art.
- From Carmack: "Incorrect decisions, made centrally, can ruin entire swathes of possibilities"
