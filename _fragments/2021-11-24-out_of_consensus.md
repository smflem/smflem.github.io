Peter Thiel rightly expounds the value of 'faith in secrets', but books like [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.ca/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/) are relatively light on how to tell when you've found one. This matters when you might be waging a big career change (like founding a startup) on whether your 'secret' is true.

What questions might we ask ourselves to pressure test whether an opportunity is real or not?

This question is not hypothetical; my wife recently left a stable, high-paying job as a (very successful) commercial banker to pursue a career as an independent theatre producer.

This was, to put it mildly, an out of consensus trade, and at times our discussions felt almost like developing an investment pitch to try to justify why a PM should put on a new position. Perhaps this isn't surprising, given that Thiel and many other investors like to style themselves as contrarian, seeking out 'secrets' that the rest of the world will catch up to.

Given even weak-form market efficiency, if you think you've identified an opportunity that no one else has (a 'secret'), you want to have a hypothesis for why that's true.

There are a couple reasons this might be happening:

1. *People don't see the opportunity*<br><br>

    There are lots of reasons for this. One way to think about this is found in Paul Sonkin's book [Pitch the Perfect Investment](https://read.amazon.ca/kp/embed?asin=B0754XYZPY&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_HA44VFK5FP0PCXB1WTA8), which breaks these failures down into issues with Dissemination (the right people don't have the information), Processing (people aren't using the right models to understand the information), and Incorporation (the 'market' is still digesting the implications of information or resolving uncertainty). For how lucrative getting this right can be, see [What Bill Gurley Saw](https://commoncog.com/blog/what-bill-gurley-saw/).
<br><br>

2. *People see the opportunity, but don't believe it's worth capturing* <br><br>

    E.g., [Matt](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-03/zillow-is-done-trading-houses) [Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-18/zillow-tried-to-make-less-money) on Zillow and iBuying. Zillow has the scale to be an effective iBuyer of homes, but realizing this opportunity would hurt their main business. Thus, the market is left to be fought over by smaller, more focused rivals like Opendoor.
<br><br>

3. *People see and attempt to capture the opportunity, but systematically can't*<br><br>

    [Webvan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan) and [Pets.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com) weren't wrong about the ultimate opportunities with online groceries / pet food, but if the world hasn't caught up to support your thesis, it doesn't matter. One version of 'being early is as bad as being wrong'.
<br><br>

4. *People 'do all the right things' but still get blown up*<br><br>

    I'm reminded here of the Japanese yen ['widowmaker'](https://www.ft.com/content/4e669a4f-544a-3e8e-a6ad-41afbd7287c2) trade, or the [sad plight](https://www.ft.com/content/4f8d65b3-6fe4-4bb9-9d13-2f8e7bf82d9f) of Tesla shorts. These trades 'should' work but have consistently, spectacularly failed.

Though not exhaustive, taken together these questions can help explore why an opportunity might be real enough to pursue. In particular, given the relative friction in making career changes / founding companies to pursue a given 'secret', the upsides of secrets likely remain large and underexploited.
