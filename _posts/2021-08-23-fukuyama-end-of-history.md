  A self-reference on Fukuyama's seminal work towards a dialectical History grounded in science and the human craving for recognition.

---

I wanted to read Francis Fukuyama's seminal 1992 text [_The End of History and the Last Man_](https://www.amazon.ca/End-History-Last-Man/dp/0743284550/) because 1) it gets referenced a lot (with varying degrees of nuance) and 2) it seemed a useful jumping off point for a cluster of reading on some current social dynamics.

The below is my effort to distill the building blocks of Fukuyama's arguments for later self-reference. Unless otherwise noted, quotes are of Fukuyama. Page numbers reference the 2006 Free Press trade paperback edition. The book is dense with insight, only a sliver of which is captured here, and well worth reading in full for those interested.

***The Premise***

To start with a too-simple binary, history can be cyclical or directional. Early Greek thinkers like Plato and Aristotle thought it was cyclical, with no specific regime or societal structure able to sustainably satisfy human needs.

Against this, Hegel and later Marx posited a directional historical process that would ultimately 'end' in some sort of final stage. This would not mean the end of events per se, but the end of a dialectical historical process and a civilizational system without inherent contradictions.

Marx grounded his big-H 'Universal History' in an economics that progressed from feudalism through capitalism into socialism. Hegel believed that liberalism, in particular the liberty and equality at the theoretic heart of the French Revolution, comprised this final stage. Alexandre Kojeve, one of Hegel's most important 20th-century interpreters, posited (somewhat tongue in cheek) that history had already ended following the Battle of Jena in 1806 which brought Napoleonic rule came to Hegel's corner of Germany.

Fukuyama's book explores this notion of directional History, in particular the question of whether liberal democracy paired with capitalism represents the 'End of History', in that it contains no inherent fundamental 'contradictions', and what that might then mean in practice for the people living in such a system.

***Directionality***

A dialectical model of History requires directionality, a one-way mechanism that precludes a cyclical progression through revolving modes of civilization. Fukuyama grounds his directionality in modern natural science as, among "the entire range of human social endeavor, the only one that is by common consensus unequivocally cumulative and directional". By expanding our knowledge of--and ability to control--the natural world, science allows humanity to incrementally satisfy its desires (e.g., food, shelter, medicine). This incremental knowledge pushes history forward.

In particular, Fukuyama focuses on the creation of new knowledge and techniques through the scientific method. He posits that this both changes the possibilities available to human civilization, and is robust to reverses and shocks (i.e., absent nuclear war humans are unlikely to 'undiscover' the scientific method).

>The possibility of mastering nature opened up by modern natural science was not a universal feature of all societies, but had to be invented at a certain point in history by certain Europeans. However, once having been invented, the scientific method became a  universal possession of rational man, potentially accessible to everyone regardless of differences in culture or nationality. Discovery of the scientific method created a fundamental, non-cyclical division of historical time into periods before and after. (pg. 72-73)

Importantly, Fukuyama is careful to clarify that this directionality doesn't necessarily mean _progress_ in the sense that many critical commentaries read into the model. While possibilities are expanded through scientific discovery, if human flourishing is diminished by the exploitation of these possibilities the model is not necessarily undermined.

This focus on scientific discovery as an engine of directionality also gives an early confirmation of the timescales we're talking about. Big changes to material possibilities through scientific discovery, and the downstream societal impacts, tend to happen on timescales of decades and centuries, not months.

>A Universal History need not justify every tyrannical regime and every war to expose a meaningful larger pattern in human evolution. The power and long-term regularity of that evolutionary process is not diminished if we admit that it was subject to large and apparently unexplainable discontinuities, any more than the biological theory of evolution is undermined by the fact of the sudden extinction of the dinosaurs. (pg. 128)

***Fulfillment of Desires via Capitalism***

Per Fukuyama, capitalism (broadly defined) has so far proven the system most robust and efficient in taking advantage of the new discoveries in natural science to enable increased human flourishing ('fulfillment of wants and desires'). In particular, he posits that the advancements in natural science that allowed industrialization have resulted in an economic system of such complexity that it is only through the decentralized allocative mechanism of market prices that the full benefits of that science can be realized.

There is no rigid prescription as to the specific point on the spectrum between laissez-faire and fully centralized allocation that is most efficient, and Fukuyama leaves the door open for forms of 'market-oriented authoritarianism' to combine some of the allocative efficiencies of market pricing with the longer-term focus of technocratic design.

As capitalism per se is not the core pillar of Fukuyama's Universal History, he spends relatively less time here. This is perhaps also due to the practicality that in 1992 (when the book was published), the centralized allocation mechanisms of Communism had been seemingly refuted through the collapse of the Soviet Union, especially compared with the economic rise of countries like China that had opened up to market mechanisms. Had this book been written at a different point in time, this may have been a larger focus.

More important to Fukuyama's thesis is the assertion that the historical need for an educated populace to support capitalist entrepreneurship created downstream political impacts and demands for liberal democratic governance.

***Recognition via Liberal democracy***

According to Fukuyama, it was in part this need for broad education that engendered and unlocked the atomistic individuality of liberal democracy. To my mind the specific mechanistic linkage is underdescribed in the book, but it appears that Fukuyama feels that universal education (at least as practiced historically) built a sense of self in all citizens that could not be sustainably satisfied in an authoritarian system. Education provided an outlet for people to exert mastery over nature through science, and a way to articulate and demand the dignity of agency in their society.

>Education teaches them that they are human beings with dignity, and that they ought to struggle to have that identity recognized (pg. 205)

While education may not be sufficient on its own, it creates pressure towards liberal democracy. In a 2018 [article](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/08/27/huntingtons-legacy/) about the legacy of Samuel Huntington, with more than 20 years of further developments since _The End of History_, Fukuyama distills this point in saying:

>If Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China become rich, high-tech societies with large middle classes and highly educated populations, will they still be content to be ruled by poorly educated clerics or Communist party apparatchiks? The possibility that they will not, and that they will demand greater political participation, is the grounds on which one might believe that convergence in regime types remains a possibility.

More broadly, Fukuyama channels Hegel (and Kojeve) in averring that it is (possibly) only in liberal democracy that man's _thymos_ can be terminally satisfied.

_Thymos_ (not italicized hereafter) is an idea originally borrowed from Plato, translated very roughly as 'spiritedness' and comprising one of three components of the soul (alongside reason and desire).

Importantly, this is a distinctly 'non-economic' concern. Contra Hobbes and Locke, Hegel contends that man is not content with satisfaction of desire and reason alone. While self-preservation is necessary, even the 'comfortable self-preservation' of Locke is not sufficient to explain much of man's behavior. Hegel contends that this third pillar of human-ness lies in the 'struggle for recognition', in the thymos.

> _Thymos_ is something like an innate human sense of justice: people believe that they have a certain worth, and when other people act as though they are worth less--when they do not _recognize_ their worth at its correct value--they become angry. (pg. 165, emphasis in the original)

In particular, Hegel sets up a theoretical distinction between masters and slaves. A master is one who is willing to risk their life in a battle for prestige (for recognition), and in making a choice against rational self-preservation proves their humanity (as distinct from an animal ruled by instinct). The slave, in his desire for self-preservation, concedes the contest and thus is not proven to be fully human.

>Man's specific dignity lies not in a superior calculating ability that makes him a cleverer machine than the lower animals, but precisely in this capacity for free moral choice. (pg. 150)

It is by directly acting against narrow self-preservation that a human can prove they are so.

But, the master also seeks recognition of their humanness by others, in fact crave such recognition as much or potentially more than material desires.

>Hegel...understands man as a moral agent whose specific dignity is related to his inner freedom from physical or natural determination. It is this moral dimension, and the struggle to have it recognized, that is the motor driving the dialectical process of history. (pg. 161)

The challenge is that in this setup recognition would only be provided by slaves. This recognition by the not-proven-human (i.e., not on a mutual and equal basis) is thin gruel, leaving the master unsatisfied.

>The problem of human history can be seen, in a certain sense, as the search for a way to satisfy the desire of _both_ masters and slaves for recognition on a mutual and equal basis; history ends with the victory of a social order that accomplishes this goal. (pg. 152, emphasis in the original)

We crave rational recognition based on the specifically human dignity of moral choice. In treating each citizen as an equal participant in the democratic process, liberal democracies provide one potential solution to this conundrum. To the extent that each citizen can equally contribute at least their vote, each citizen is afforded a baseline recognition of their humanness by all other citizens.

>Kojeve's claim that we are at the end of history therefore stands or falls on the strength of the assertion that the recognition provided by contemporary liberal democratic states adequately satisfies the human desire for recognition (pg. 207)

Alternative political structures like fascism and communism fail to afford this recognition to all citizens, and thus contain inherent contradictions in the dialectical sense. Fascism explicitly maintains the master/slave structure, and in doing so fails to recognize the humanity of its adherents qua humans. Without enemies to test one's will against, the thymos is left unsatisfied. Communism, at least as practiced to date, fails to provide for its citizens desires. In doing so their thymos is also neglected, as their comparisons to other (more economically successful peoples) will find them degraded in recognition.

People can also crave distinct flavors of thymos (as coined by Fukuyama): isoythymia (recognition as equal) and megalothymia (recognition as superior). Liberal democracy delivers a morsel of isothymia to all citizens, in its recognition of them as such.

Thus, it is liberal democracy, paired with capitalism, that is offered as a potential endpoint for the 'End of History'.

>The universal and homogeneous state that appears at the end of history can thus be seen as resting on the twin pillars of economics and recognition (pg. 204)

The question looming over this end of history is whether this is sufficiently satisfying of material desires and cravings for recognition over the long run, or whether this model also contains inherent contradictions.

***The Last Man***

The seeming arrival of the End of History gives rise to the Last Men, living in a system that reliably delivers material desires and thymotic recognition through markets and liberal democracy. These citizens live a life apart from the First Men that might have existed in a previously imagined 'state of nature', or in the contradiction-riddled societies previously tried.

In this final section of the book, Fukuyama asks what a potential society of Last Men might look like, and whether it might truly be sustainable in its lack of contradictions--fulfilling the dialectical process of History.

With the benefit of almost 30 years of hindsight, Fukuyama comes off as remarkably prescient in his concerns with this version of the 'End of History', including that:

- Absolute tolerance and equality undermine the community and values necessary to sustain a society over the long-run, and is likely impossible anyway
- Citizens will be unsatisfied by the isothymia on offer from liberal democracy (because tolerance has sapped it of its meaning, or because it's just boring)
- Citizens will be unsatisfied by the safe outlets for megalothymia available, and resort to destructive behavior

In its quest for tolerance (in order to accept and recognize all people as people), liberal democracy undermines its own premise, by dissolving the space and means for moral choice. If all actions or perspectives are acceptable, along which vectors shall we choose? If all are to be esteemed, with no criteria nor judgment except that which allows all members to be accepted, is there any value left in the esteeming? Who esteems in such a system?

Liberal democracy seeks to fulfill the 'struggle for recognition' in all (i.e., achieve universal isothymia) as humans. But many may find it insufficient to be universally recognized as merely human, the lowest common denominator.

>Is recognition that can be universalized worth having in the first place? Is not the _quality_ of recognition far more important than its universality? And does not the goal of universalizing recognition inevitably trivialize and de-value it? (pg. 301, emphasis in the original)

>The problem with the present-day self-esteem movement is that its members, living as they do in a democratic and egalitarian society, are seldom willing to make choices concerning what should be esteemed (pg. 303)

>In a democracy we are fundamentally averse to saying that a certain person, or way of life, or activity, is better and more worthwhile than another (pg. 303)

Judgment and thus intolerance are arguably necessary to fulfilling the struggle for recognition. Without a common 'language of good and evil'--the logical conclusion of liberal democracy's push for universallizing tolerance--communities cannot define an inside or outside, and so lose their integrity and their vitality. Without criteria for confirming or denying acceptable behavior, communities will dissolve.

>One of the most common complaints about the character of contemporary American life is precisely its lack of _community_. (pg. 242, emphasis in the original)

>This decline has occurred not _despite_ liberal principles, but _because_ of them. (pg. 326,  emphasis in the original)

Fukuyama also discusses the 'irrational' underpinnings of many community values, including what we would consider 'work ethic'. The value of work for its own sake (pride of labor) requires a 'pre-modern' set of values that could well degenerate under liberal capitalism (e.g., the push for "meaningful work" or "self-realization" through work). At least for the most dynamic, competitive workers and societies, there are thymotic aspects to work that make it about more than mere self-preservation or marginal utility of money. Liberal tolerance risks undermining 'pre-modern' values like work ethic that make communities possible.

>In the long run those liberal principals had a corrosive effect on the values predating liberalism necessary to sustain strong communities, and thereby on a liberal society's ability to be self-sustaining (pg. 327)

Without space or motivation for moral choice, many might retreat to a focus on their desires and wants. Yet this hedonic myopia risks leaving a society vulnerable to stasis and a loss of dynamism. Per Nietzsche, "one must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star" (pg. 304)

Moreover if we confirm our humanity in our acts against our own self-interest and towards those of our fellow human, this would necessarily mean those whose focus is so narrow are less-fully-human. Do we not hold in contempt the _bourgeois_, who see only to their desires and reason with no thymotic spirit? We do not valorize Nietzsche's 'men without chests'.

While there remains a risk of "becoming secure and self-absorbed last men, devoid of thymotic striving for higher goals in our pursuit of private comforts", there is also the danger of reverting to being "first men engaged in bloody and pointless prestige battles" (pg. 328) Tolerance leave a society open to damage by those who seek megalothymia, recognition as being superior to others.

From de Tocqueville:

>I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world. The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men, all equal and alike, _incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they gut their lives_. Each of them, living apart, is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest; his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, he is close to them, but does not see them; he touches them, but he does not feel them; he exists only in himself and for himself alone; and if his kindred still remain to him, he may be said at any rate to have lost his country.  Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood; it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing but rejoicing. (pg. 308-309, emphasis added)

In his book, Fukuyama outlines a number of potential 'safe' outlets for megalothymia that are consistent with a well-functioning liberal democracy:
- Entrepreneurship and other forms of economic activity
- Democratic politics
- Purely formal activities (i.e. games)

Yet he is clear that these outlets may be insufficient to channel and curb the human craving for recognition, and that the result could constitute a problematic contradiction in liberal democracy.

>To the extent that liberal democracy is successful at purging megalothymia from life and substituting for it rational consumption, we will become last men. But human beings will rebel at this thought. That is, they will rebel at the idea of being undifferentiated members of a universal and homogeneous state, each the same as the other no matter where on the globe one goes. They will want to be citizens, rather than bourgeois, finding the life of masterless slaver--the life of _rational consumption_--in the end, **boring**. They will want to have ideals by which to live and die, even if the largest ideals have been substantively realized here on earth, and they will want to risk their lives even if the international state system has succeeded in abolishing the possibility of war. This is the "contradiction" that liberal democracy has not yet solved (pg. 314, emphasis modified)

What if there are no sufficient outlets for struggle? There may be an upwelling of struggle for the sake of struggle.

>They will struggle for the sake of struggle. They will struggle, in other words, out of a certain boredom: for they cannot imagine living in a world without struggle. And if the greater part of the world in which they live is characterized by peaceful and prosperous liberal democracy, then they will struggle _against_ that peace and prosperity, against democracy (pg. 330, emphasis in original)

>Modern thought raises no barriers to a future nihilistic war against liberal democracy on the part of those brought up in its bosom. Relativism--the doctrine that maintains that all values are merely relative and which attacks all "privileged perspectives"-- must ultimately end up undermining democratic and tolerant values as well. Relativism is not a weapon that can be aimed selectively at the enemies one chooses. It fires indiscriminately, shooting out the legs of not only the "absolutisms," dogmas, and certainties of the Western tradition, but that tradition's emphasis on tolerance, diversity, and freedom of thought as well. If nothing can be true absolutely, if all values are culturally determined, then cherished principles like human equality will have to go by the wayside as well. (pg. 332)

It is left as an exercise to the reader to decide whether these concerns seem valid in 2021.

Fukuyama closes by comparing the movement of societies through the historical process as wagon trains moving across country. Perhaps in time it will be clear that all different societies were in fact going towards the same endpoint (liberal democracy and capitalism), but this isn't yet clear, nor is it clear that some might reach town and wonder what might be still further along the road.
