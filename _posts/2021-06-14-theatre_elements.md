title:  "Theatre: Elements of Difference"
date:   2021-06-21

From the Greeks to the Globe to the Great White Way, theatre has been an important artistic and cultural medium for millenia. Yet in an age of zero-marginal-cost *Content*, the ongoing commercial and cultural relevance of theatre is precarious. Ticket prices are rising, yet economic sustainability remains elusive, raising the worry that theatre is a fading relic of a time before mechanical reproduction.

Yet, there is nothing *quite* like being in a theatre. Experiencing a play or a musical or an opera is not the same as watching a movie, whether in a movie theater or at home. In my opinion, at its best the live performing arts can achieve unique emotional heights unavailable to other mediums.

But *how*? What makes theatre different? And should we believe--despite relentless pressure from competing mediums and cost increases--that this special thing can be protected? If so, what elements are most important / differentiated / worth saving? What will actually be saved?

I hope to work through this in three parts:

1) A unique medium: What makes theatre special?<br>
2) Crushing economics: The impact of cost disease and scalability on theatre<br>
3) Future possibilities: How to save the soul of theatre (even if the existing body dies)<br>

In this essay, I aim to explore the combination of traits that make theatre unique relative to competing mediums like movies, television, and other formats of video content (e.g., TikTok)[^mediums]. In part 3, I'll try to reason through which of these things are integral, or what can be changed while still recognizing the result as theatre.

While I won't be focusing on the underlying goals of art / entertainment per se, any discussion of art inherently rests on an implied understanding of ends[^gioia]. So for clarity, I think of art, and especially art forms like movies and musicals, to be seeking some or all of the following:

- *Beauty*, aesthetic appreciation
- *Novelty*, as in either the new-to-a-layperson sense, or in the more formal artistic sense in which a work juxtaposes itself with an existing tradition
- *Education*, in terms of transmitting social norms, values, and ways of being or thinking
- *Emotion*, as in calling forth / creating an emotion in the person experiencing the art
- *Connection*, between people experiencing the art, between the audience and performer, or between the audience and people more generally
- *Recognition*, in the Hegelian sense of being *seen* by an other

While there isn't an objective sense in which different art forms are more aesthetically pleasing than others[^pots_plinths], the other ends can all be addressed to some degree by theatre. In what follows, I'll discuss some of the ways that theatre is in fact uniquely suited to achieving these artistic aims.

<br>
So what is it that makes *Theatre*?

<br>

Theatre is:
1. Live
2. Interactive
3. Immersive
4. Story-driven

<br>
# *1. Live*

The art is created simultaneously with the audience's experience of it. This aspect has a number of effects, including (but not limited to):

- The opportunity for variability and surprise with no editing
- The thrill of watching performative feats (e.g., solos) with no second takes
- The opportunity for audience-performer interaction and co-creation
- The strengthened sense of connection between audience and performer ("we're sharing this time as they create this", "they're creating this right now, for me")
- A strengthened sense of a performance being a unique event ("we're all experiencing this together in time")

<br>
# *2. Interactive*

*Audience-audience interaction*

The audience creates their experience of the show together. The applause break, the collectively held breath, the reactions at intermission&mdash;these are integral to the live performing arts.

- I see you experiencing this art

  Viewers value the direction of others in shaping their reactions to an experience. This is why studio audiences and laugh tracks gained such prominence in television, where there isn't otherwise context or guidance on how to react to what's on screen. The recent rise of 'reaction videos' shows the persistence of this desire.

- You see me experiencing this art

  While I'm not sure how relevant this is for most people most of the time, there remains a status element to being at an exclusive performance or premier that can be hard to match natively in other mediums.

- We're experiencing this art together

  To the extent that an audience member feels in sync with their peers, audience-audience interaction serves to heighten the emotions of each, and strengthens shared connections and sense of recognition.

<br>
*Audience-performer interaction*

The presence of an audience can help performers reach new peaks of excellence in their craft. Performing for an empty hall or for a production crew behind bulky equipment is not the same as performing in a hall of rapt audience members or a stadium of raving fans. Though norms differ on what type of interaction is valued, the live performing arts generally excel in creating opportunities for audience-performer interactions.

Further, audience members value the opportunity to interact with and be acknowledged by performers, whether through standing applause or heckling. Even just a recognition of the audience by the performers can make an experience more meaningful.

While this is possible in other mediums and formats, these interactions are native to the live performing arts to an extent that has not yet been achieved elsewhere.

<br>
# *3. Immersive*

Immersion will strengthen an audience's experience of the work, leveraging a feeling of it being 'real' into a stronger artistic punch.

To oversimplify, immersion depends on 3 things: sensory perception, narrative coherence, and ritual departure.

*Sensory Perception*

Watching Jurassic Park on your laptop is much different than seeing it in a modern movie theatre. In the latter, the T-Rex fills and overflows your field of vision, the sound of its stomping and roaring surrounds you. In the former, the Brobdingnagian dino might be 8 inches tall, its roars withered by tinny speakers, all diluted by overhead lighting and surrounding distractions.

Which will make the king of the dinosaurs feel more real? Which will be more terrifying, and thus a more satisfying foe for our heros' ultimate victory?

Theatre is performed and experienced in person[^COVID]. Unmediated by a screen, compression algorithms, or editing, theatre has the capacity to feel even more 'real' than movies or television thanks to its high perceptual bandwidth. Properly done, the aesthetic experience can be richer, empathy with the actors can be stronger, and connection among the audience can be much more powerful. Though there can also be hindrances to this (e.g., coughing, obstructed views), for stories than can be reasonably portrayed in a theatre[^space_opera], theatre can thus provide an immersive sensory experience.

*Narrative Coherence*

Dialogue that doesn't fit how people actually talk, decisions that don't make sense given our understanding of a character, a [human hand][judi_dench_hand] in a movie about anthropomorphic cats&mdash;these can all break the sense of immersion for an audience.

Audiences can swallow a space western with laser swords and magic powers, so long as the portrayal of lovable rogues and cold villains feels right. Similarly, works that explore inner turmoil and the limits of human behavior are mostly set in 'real-world' conditions[^scifi_exception] to avoid asking too much of the audience.

This is a differentiator of good and bad works, but not systematically between theatre and other mediums.

*Ritual Departure*

Beyond the specific sensory perception of a show already discussed, there can be immersion-value in the ritual aspect of a performance. Going to a new location, walking through a dark stairwell or tunnel, and sitting (or standing) in a purpose-built space&mdash;these (and other) ritual cues can all serve to separate an artistic experience from our 'normal' lives and deepen immersion in a work.

The possibility to employ this portion of the immersive toolkit varies by medium and work, but I would argue that today it is the theatre that most reliably deploys ritual in its performances[^tiktok_ritual].

<br>
To give one example of these taken together: I attended a show about a musically-oriented cult, it's recently-deceased founder, and his family. Staged in a church, the show included a welcome on arrival by costumed-disciples, bound custom psalm books with the cult's teachings and songs, and a 'tuning' exercise for willing audience members prior to the opening. We were physically among the performers and asked to sing along at key moments. By the time the kool-aid was passed around at the climax, it took a moment of hesitation before I could drink it, so thorough was my immersion in the performance.

<br>
# *4. Story-driven*

Theatre is generally story-driven. This might seem obvious, but does in fact differentiate it from the norms in some competing mediums.

For example, this is distinct from a medium like television[^streaming_characters] where the focus is primarily on the characters. I've been known to gripe that, beyond the first season or two, most television becomes a soap opera as it devolves around the characters and their relationships, with no interesting ongoing story[^tv_soap]. This is also distinct from more extemporaneous art forms that might otherwise be lumped into the live performing arts. For example, things like improv wouldn't fit the bill as 'story-driven', since the narrative arc is primarily dependent on atomistic story elements generated and discarded throughout the show.

In its focus on story, theatre is more like film. Both tend to have run-time measured in single-digit hours and be consumed in a single evening[^harry_potter]. This matters because it allows artists to tell more coherent stories, stories focused on change and tight pacing rather than an incremental attachment to characters. To the extent that theatre artists succeed in crafting these types of stories, the result can be a stronger, more targeted artistic impact. More prosaically, this pacing and length also allows the live, interactive, and immersive elements described earlier without overtaxing the audience.

-

As deployed in theatre, these factors serve to generate strong responses in audiences, in a way unique to the medium. Despite attempts throughout the pandemic, to my knowledge no one has been able to match this unique artistic impact in a different format.

Yet as mentioned already, theatre remains under threat. With challenging economics and increasing competition, theatre risks serving a shrinking audience at inflated prices.

In the next post, I'll explore where these challenges come from and what might be done about them.

<br>

[^theatre]: When I say 'theatre' I am referring to the plays, musicals, and operas traditionally performed in theatres. While these have many similarities with other live performing arts (e.g., ballet, symphony), I feel they are sufficiently distinct (especially in terms of narrative structure) to treat separately.

[^COVID]: The pandemic has inevitably muddied this somewhat, with a number of 'plays' and 'musicals' taking on new remote formats. The four variables outlined may help in understanding why those generally haven't 'worked' as well as 'normal' theatre.

[^mediums]: Frankly, these boundaries feel increasingly artificial as distribution moves online and the focus on a 'metaverse' of content increases. I am not here to litigate the television-like character development of the MCU, or the movie-length episodes of BBC's Sherlock series; 'movies' and 'television' are just helpful shorthand.

[^gioia]: I particularly like Dana Gioia's [framing](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/dana-gioia/), which assumes an artist and asks: 1) What are they trying to do? 2) How well do they do that? 3) Is what they're trying to do worthwhile?

[^streaming_characters]: Or maybe streaming? One way to think of streamer's ongoing appeal is as a character in an ongoing drama, where recurring viewers (subs) value the feeling of spending time with / seeing the growth of the character more than the specifics of the object-level 'story' that might be happening in the game (e.g., speedrun, challenges).

[^lost_finale]: This is one of the reasons series finales for long-running, 'story' driven shows so often fail to satisfy their fans (e.g., Lost, Game of Thrones)

[^pots_plinths]: I don't necessarily embrace the strong-form of this assertion. 'Pots on plinths' is still a problem when we think about novelty in the context of sculpture. One could reasonably argue that a disembodied medium like film truly does have a larger possibility space for novelty than a (currently, mostly) physically-constrained medium like musical theatre.

[^space_opera]: It's important to note that the opportunities here differ by medium and narrative goals though. Dinosaurs and space operas are likely better left to the wizards of ILM or Weta.

[^dr_silver]: [*Dr Silver: A Celebration of Life*](https://musicalstagecompany.com/shows/dr-silver-a-celebration-of-life/) put on by The Musical Stage Co and Outside the March in Toronto in 2018.

[^scifi_exception]: One seeming exception is science fiction, where the alternative world is often constructed specifically to probe our understanding of human behavior in new contexts.

[^tiktok_ritual]: If a truly immersive theatre experience like [*Sleep No More*](https://mckittrickhotel.com/sleep-no-more/) at the McKittrick Hotel is one end of this spectrum, toggling between TikTok and Twitter is the other. How much can anything on the latter really hit you given such little set up?

[^tv_soap]: This is not necessarily television's fault per se. It's incredibly difficult to plan and execute coherent story arcs that actually make sense over an uncertain number of seasons, when you can't rely on an audience being there through the whole journey (see: Lost, Game of Thrones). So showrunners mostly focus on open-ended character development to ground their undertaking.

[^harry_potter]: Or a single day, in the case of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which takes contains 4 acts performed in 2 sittings in a single day.
