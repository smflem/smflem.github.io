title:  "Cycling strategy"

One of the fascinating things about sports is the extent to which dominant strategies arise from the basic interplay between the rules, the constraints of physics, and the goals of competitors.

- *Run fastest from A to B, no (excessive) shoving*
- *Swim x laps the fastest, in this specific way*
- *Get the ball in the goal, without using your hands*
- *Get the ball in the basket, more points if you shoot from further*

To my delight, I recently found the same to be true about cycling races, which I had frankly never really understood. *"Bike fastest from A to B"*, while true on its face, does little to convey the rich strategies and captivating uncertainty contained within. Thankfully, a recent 2-week quarantine allowed me to get _way_ too into the 2021 Giro d'Italia, a 21-stage 'Grand Tour'[^grand_tour], and get a much better understanding of this underrated sport.

This post is an attempt to lay out how I think about the competitive variables of cycling road racing, and how those interact to create thrilling moments of prowess.

# **The Constraints**

Beyond the UCI's[^uci] stringent sock regulations, there are a number of key constraints teams and riders must overcome to win a bike race, constraints that fundamentally shape the competition.

# Air resistance

As they ride, cyclists are always fighting air resistance and drag. The energy required to overcome air resistance increases non-linearly with speed, sharpening its impact. Going 10% faster than your competition requires more than 10% extra effort.

At the same time, drafting&mdash;riding behind someone else at a close distance&mdash;reduces the air resistance that a rider must overcome, allowing them to use less energy to maintain a given speed (or briefly go faster for a given output). As a result, on flat roads where average speeds are high, air resistance will dominate in determining the shape of the race, leading to pelotons and other group formations[^teams] at the expense of individual attacks.

# Gravity

On hills, where speeds are relatively lower, gravity reasserts itself. For a given power output, being heavier&mdash;whether in equipment, muscles or fat&mdash;will make a rider slower to ascend a climb. The converse is also true: if a given power output can be maintained, less weight will mean more speed up hills.

As speed drops on climbs, the benefits of sitting in the bunch diminish, forcing riders to increase their efforts or fall off the back of the group. And so, pelotons can get blown apart by hills, with sprinters and spent domestiques falling behind to limp across the finish line ahead of the time cutoff.

# Bike Handling

Professional cyclists ride very fast, up and down hills, over gravel and cobbles. They do all this on tires with a few centimeters of ground contact, surrounded by 100+ teammates and competitors. Falls happen, and they can be individually and collectively catastrophic. Yet slow down for safety, and a more aggressive rival might seize the opening.

Thus, despite the ever-finer quantification of training and performance in the sport, bike handling and positioning still play an important role. Top riders need to be able to hold their space in the peloton, navigate to the front of the group at key moments to avoid being dropped (or caught behind a crash), and descend with speed and sureness.

# Human physiology

*'Do they have the legs...?'*

This sentiment gets to the heart of bicycle racing. It's ultimately people, and their legs, that push the bikes forward. But not all legs on all days are equal in potential or realized output.

To oversimplify, a rider might know that they have a certain reserve of energy and can output so many watts for so many hours before exhaustion[^fueling]. They might further know that they can realize a much higher peak output, but only for a dozen seconds (in the case of a sprint) or a few minutes (in the case of a maximum climbing effort), and at the cost of disproportionate drain on their reserves (and damage to their bodies).

The trick is&mdash;unlike an engineered system&mdash;these variables are strictly unknowable. Past experience (by the rider, and as observed by their and their opposing teams) will be some guide, but not nearly enough to avoid upsets and surprises.

If a rider sprints off the front of the group (expending a huge amount of energy), will they have enough left to carry them to the finish in the lead? How will the motivation of [eleven][nizzolo_background] 2nd-place finishes impact someone's sprint effort? When the final hill arrives, after >170km of riding[^preamble], which of the leaders are fresh enough to attack (or even just keep the pace)? Will heroic efforts in stage [9][bernal_gravel_finish], [14][bernal_zoncolan], and [16][bernal_giau] leave a leader assailable by stage [17][bernal_struggling]?

This is essentially endurance poker played over hours and weeks in the saddle, decided by a margin of seconds and minutes at the key moments.

# **The Stakes: Different ways to win**

For a sport superficially about getting from A to B the fastest, there are many ways to win. Within the constraints and within the same race, different teams can be pursuing different goals at different times, heightening the action and multiplying opportunities for exhibitions of excellence.

# Stage Wins

This is the most basic unit of victory available. First to the finish line at the end of the day's racing wins the stage.

# General Classification (GC)

The rider with the lowest cumulative time across all stages of the race leads the General Classification. In the Giro, this rider wears a pink jersey, the _maglia rosa_, to denote their preeminence.

GC success is reserved for those athletes and teams able to perform consistently across thousands of kilometers and weeks of racing, with energy in reserve to attack when their competitors flag (often on a climb).

The margin of success is narrow. Across more than 86 hours of racing, the winning gap at this year's Giro was just 1 minute and 29 seconds.

When people talk of 'winning' Grand Tours like the Giro or the Tour de France, this is what they mean. Interestingly, a rider doesn't need to win any specific stages to win overall; Egan Bernal won the 2019 Tour de France without winning a single stage.

# Points Classification

Riders earn points based on their placing at stage finishes and some intermediate sprints[^intermediate_sprints]. Because of their tendency to win stages and place well in group finishes, sprinters have often led this category in recent years. In the 2021 Giro, the leader of this category wore a mauve jersey, the _maglia ciclamino_.

# Mountains Classification (King of the Mountains)

Riders earn 'King of the Mountain' points[^kom_points] for reaching the tops of climbs first, with the points available dependent on the difficulty of a given climb. The highest peak in the Giro is known as the Cima Coppi (honoring Italian cyclist Fausto Coppi) and carries the most KOM points of any of the race's peaks. In the latest Giro, the KOM leader wore a blue jersey[^kom_jersey].

# **The Strategic Results**

So, we know the constraints and the goals. What forms does the racing take as a result?

# The Sprint (Stage Wins / Points)

For those sufficiently-flat stages where the peloton remains intact, the stage win is generally decided by a sprint. While a breakaway might form, the drafting benefits of remaining in the peloton (and the return-on-effort for teams working to put sprinters into position) are almost sure to bring the group together for the final kilometers.

In an ideal world, a successful sprint involves a team forming a 'leadout train' and 'dropping off' their sprinter with ~150-200m left for their final huge effort[^sprint_gremlin]. This [stage finish][paris-nice_dck_leadout] from this year's Paris-Nice is a good example of what this _should_ look like.

Because the world is rarely ideal, the reality is often much messier. These wins from [Caleb][caleb_ewan_win_1] [Ewan][caleb_ewan_win_2], [Giacomo Nizzolo][nizzolo_win], and [Peter Sagan][peter_sagan_win] give a sense of the chaos top sprinters navigate on their way to victory.

One interesting alternative to the textbook leadout, attempted in stages [3][bh_pace_sagan_3] and [10][bh_pace_sagan_10] by Bora-Hansgrohe, is to push the pace of the peloton so high _before_ the sprint that other team's sprinters get dropped. Because Peter Sagan is _relatively_ better at hills than some of his sprint rivals, his team can distance other sprinters by pushing the pace through the hills, improving Sagan's odds at the finish.

# The Breakaway (Stage Wins / KOM)

How do you win a stage when you're not a sprinter or a GC contender? By getting away and staying away from the peloton.

In the early portions of a stage, riders will often set off from the front of the group in the hopes of forming a breakaway[^normal_breakaway]. They want other riders, but not the whole peloton, to follow their move[^get_across] and share the workload. This requires a huge surge in effort, often coupled with the element of surprise to keep too many chasers from following. With enough riders working together, and some luck and divergent goals among the chasing teams[^controlling_the_race], someone in the breakaway can have a chance at the stage win.

Notably, breakaways rarely contain the GC leaders. If a leader did make it into the breakaway, opposing teams would be expected to increase the pace of the chasing group until any gap was closed. This near certainty makes the effort expenditure to get into a breakaway a bad bet for GC contenders. As a result, breakaways tend to be populated by those non-sprinters seeking stage wins (or KOM points).

Whereas sprints are decided by timing, positioning, and maximum output levels, the breakaway's success depends on judicious expenditure of energy. Don't spend enough, and the breakaway is caught. Overspend as a group and fatigue, and the breakaway is caught. Overspend as an individual, and the breakaway might stay away but you'll lose to a fresher rival at the final hill or sprint.

Again, these levels aren't strictly knowable. A world-class time triallist[^time_trial] like Remi Cavagna can jump ahead with a [huge effort][cavagna_attempt], only to hit his limit with <7km left. Others can find themselves with enough left to secure a stage win on their first Grand Tour, like [Taco van der Hoorn][taco_surprise_win] and [Lorenzo Fortunata][fortunata_zoncolan] did at this year's Giro.

# Attacking Downhill (GC / Stage Wins)

While it is rare[^downhill_attack] for races or even stages to be won on descents, it does happen. The most memorable (for me at least) was Chris Froome's performance in [Stage 8][froome_tour_8][^froome_descent] of the 2016 Tour de France (before the 'supertuck' was [banned][supertuck_ban] by the UCI).

Unfortunately, the time gained through aggressiveness in cornering can be lost just as quickly in a crash, as [Fernando Gaviria][fernando_gaviria_crash] and [Remi Cavagna][remi_cavagna_crash] showed at this year's Giro. Thus, while attacking downhill can be used to stretch out the group and potentially open up gaps behind to rivals, it is rarely sufficient on its own to take a win or regain significant time in the GC standings.

# Attacking Uphill (GC / Stage Wins / KOM)

Where GC contenders rarely participate in sprints or breakaways per se, their viability as racers depends on hanging with and attacking rivals uphill, especially at uphill finishes.

After 4+ hours of riding, as the pace slows to a crawl up punishing climbs, drafting behind teammates becomes untenable and it falls to the leaders to fend for themselves (or, if they're really lucky, follow [Danny Martinez][bernal_struggling]). And these climbs really are punishing. Famous Giro climbs like the Monte Zoncolan (~14km long, ~8.5% gradient for ~1,200m of elevation gain) and the Passo Giau (~10km, ~9.3% gradient) torture even the best cyclists in the world.

Highlights fail to capture the real magic of this. Riders grinding away at the edge of their limit for dozens of minutes, attacking and counter-attacking each other to see who's got anything left, or just keeping the pace so thumpingly high that a burst to get ahead becomes impossible. These extreme demands drive the divergence in times for the GC contenders, with only the strongest and most wily able to triumph.

Those able to keep the pace and even attack beyond their rivals' limit earn themselves overall victory.

# **The Winning**

So where does all that leave us:
- With Filippo Ganna, the best time triallist in the world, pushing the wind at the front of the peloton on the flats
- With Danny Martinez, an exceptional climber and time triallist, setting the pace uphill
- So that Egan Bernal can lay down an [explosive climbing effort][bernal_gravel_finish] at just the right moment to distance his GC opponents

Or:
- Bora-Hansgrohe pushing the pace through the hills
- So that Peter Sagan can [sprint to victory][peter_sagan_win] against depleted or absent rivals

Or:
- Taco van der Hoorn taking the [surprise win][taco_surprise_win] from the breakaway

The simple but implacable constraints, coupled with the diversity of ways to win, fill cycling with the riveting uncertainty that make it so exciting to watch.

<br>

[^uci]: The governing body of cycling, the [UCI][uci], is rightfully [mocked][uci_mocked] for its extensive rulebook. But for the most part, professional cyclists are able to wear the correct length socks and chuck their water bottles in the right places.
[^intermediate_sprints]: Checkpoints along the course in some stages, awarding either points or seconds off overall cumulative time (for those seeking GC glory). Usually flat-ish areas to keep these distinct from mountain checkpoints used for the mountains classification.
[^kom_points]: KOM points are distinct from the points used for the points jersey.
[^sprint_gremlin]: Personally, I find the frantic-gremlin position sprinters assume for maximum output to be just beautiful to watch, with hours of racing consummated in a chaotic dozen seconds.
[^froome_descent]: As he attacked at the top of a gnarly climb ahead of a downhill finish, his opponents (and the commentators) seemed to think he was just seeking KOM points. But he just kept on riding, over the top and down the other side, getting into (and even pedalling in) the aerodynamic 'supertuck' position to distance his rivals on a tricky descent. Froome stayed away across the line, gaining the yellow jersey that he would wear all the way into Paris.
[^fueling]: At sufficiently high rates of effort, even perfect fuelling and hydration will only serve to delay this point.
[^preamble]: In some sense, the 4-5 hours of road racing before the final climb or sprint merely serve to deplete everyone's reserves, to force a test to see who's still got it at the end.
[^controlling_the_race]: Key GC teams will often 'control' the race by setting the pace at the front to avoid endless attacking that could raise the pace and tire their leader at the wrong moment. If they don't feel threatened by the composition of a breakaway group, they might intentionally slow to allow the breakaway to gain distance and discourage further attacking from within the peloton (until a climb or a sprint).
[^time_trial]: Meaning, he should have a better-than-most sense of his ability to pace and sustain an effort over 20-30km.
[^downhill_attack]: Distancing rivals often also means distancing teammates. Because most stages don't end on or near descents, any time gained has to be held through a sustained solo effort against pursuers that can coordinate and share effort (though, again, [Chris][froome_giro_19_1] [Froome][froome_giro_19_2]!).
[^normal_breakaway]: I'm using the term breakaway here to denote the 'normal' kind in which a group of 5-20 riders will sprint off the front of a peloton on a relatively flat portion of the race to form a group. Not to be confused with the breaking apart of the peloton as it reaches late-stage categorized climbs and GC leaders vie for supremacy.
[^get_across]: Once a breakaway has started to form, riders sometimes try to 'get across' or 'bridge' the gap between the peloton and the breakaway, laying down an effort against air resistance to reach the shelter of the breakaway group.
[^teams]: Previously I had only a vague sense that cycling occurred in teams--that it was the USPS-sponsored team as much as the doping that help Lance Armstrong to victory--I had never really understood how or why that was so. The tyranny of air resistance along with the limits of human physiology mean it is much faster to work in groups to share the effort of breaking the wind. This further allows specialization among teammates, with heavier riders having the power to push the pace on flats to set up climbing specialists or sprinters for glory at the finish.
[^grand_tour]: There are 3 Grand Tours: The Giro d'Italia, The Tour De France, The Vuelta a Espana. Each contain 21 stages spread over more than 3 weeks of competition. For many, these represent the competitive pinnacle of the sport.
[^kom_jersey]: Technically the _maglia azzurra_, but no one seemed to refer to this by color, presumably since it used to be green and only changed in 2012 due to a sponsor demand.
