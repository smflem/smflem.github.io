This time last year, I came across Steven Soderbergh’s [list](http://extension765.com/sdr/22-seen-read-2014) of all the media he had consumed in 2014 and thought it might be interesting to track my own intake of entertainment for 2015. So throughout the year, I made a note anytime I read a book or watched a movie. The results of this exercise follow below.

Overall, I’d say I read more fiction this past year than the previous couple of years combined. I’m hoping to be able to keep this up going forward. My movie tastes, at least this year, also skewed more towards the blockbuster than I would have expected, we’ll see if that holds up going forward.
Works are listed generally in the order I read/watched them, except TV. I was too lazy to track individual episodes so I just listed the series I watched this year.

TL; DR — I read and watched a bunch of stuff last year.

Looking for recommendations for 2016.
