I struggle to focus enough to write at length (i.e., longer than a well structured email), but I need to write to get through my upcoming grad degree in journalism, so this site is meant as a repository for writing practice. The initial goal is volume of output, not quality, so assume everything is half-baked and quarter-edited.
