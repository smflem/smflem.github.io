  Why did me and my MBA classmates make wildly different decisions when COVID hit New York?
---

As I write this, I’m living with my fiancee’s parents in the suburbs of Toronto, having effectively fled New York City in the face of the growing pandemic threat from the virus SARS-CoV-2 / the disease COVID-19 / the phenomenon ‘coronavirus’.

When I decided late on March 14th to leave the city, there were 525 confirmed cases according to data aggregated by Johns-Hopkins. When I flew out the next day, that had risen to 732. Today, 25 days later, there are 5,150 deaths in the city, and more than 87,000 confirmed cases.

Despite this, it is not yet clear whether I made the right decision. Ontario is experiencing it’s own exponential ascent, potentially only weeks behind with its 5,759 confirmed cases and 200 deaths. But still, I left.

I was fortunate to have the flexibility to go (as a student), the financial resources to go (as a former consultant) and a place to go to (as a Canadian citizen with welcoming in-laws). While many people don’t share those advantages, many of my business school classmates found themselves in similar positions. Some left, many did not.

Much has already been written about recent decision making at societal levels, and the numerous repeated government failures in the US, but less has been written about migration choices made by individuals, except insofar as these have risked swamping rural areas with new residents.

So, focusing on those with the potential ability to migrate, I want to explore 3 potential decision factors between those who actually left, and those who stayed:

1. Awareness of a change in the environment

2. Scope and scale of adaptive change required

3. Capacity for adaptive change

Taken together, I think these can explain a large part of the observed variation in efforts to leave New York by me and my classmates. But this is also potentially extensible to decision-making and outcomes in urgent crises more broadly. One vivid potential example is documented by William Langewiesche in [his retelling](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/05/a-sea-story/302940/) of the sinking of the ferry MS Estonia in 1994, during which 852 of 989 people on board died.


Awareness of change in the environment
======================================

Basically, were you paying attention to COVID-19, was the quality of your incoming information high, and did you understand what it meant? Did you realize what was about to hit New York?

As with any exponential crisis not being closely followed, COVID-19 seemed superficially fine to many, until suddenly it wasn’t. It was a hoax, or it wasn’t a big deal, or it was a big deal but only in China, or it was a big deal in China and countries with a lot of old people like Italy, but not here…

At the same time, if you were in the [right parts](https://stratechery.com/2020/zero-trust-information/) of Twitter at the [right time](https://stratechery.com/2020/defining-information/), or received the right newsletters, you would have been hearing a much different story, one in which a world-altering wave was starting to come ashore as the mayor from Jaws was telling people to go back in the water.

I don’t want to belabor this point, as I think it risks making me look more prescient than I am, but suffice to say if you weren’t paying attention until after stores were cleared of soup and toilet paper then you probably didn’t leave the city.


Scope of change required
========================

So, let’s say you were sufficiently worried about COVID-19 in February to think about leaving New York, how big of a change would that be for you? How much disruption and dislocation would be required to meaningfully reduce your exposure risk?

For me—remote student, Canadian citizen, welcoming family—the change required was manageable. For many, the change required would have been enormous, depending on the hold of their ties to New York and on the lack of obvious places to leave to. People with children, or with spouses employed locally, or who didn’t have any family outside the city, would have faced multi-layered and likely insurmountable barriers to moving in response to the pandemic.

That said, I think there was a large murky middle ground here with many people facing barriers to migration within an order of magnitude or two of me. Complicating matters though, your estimates of the disruption of leaving the city are directly related to the accuracy of your estimates of how life in the city is going to change through the pandemic .

If you expected New York to be mostly unchanged save a bit more hand-washing and no Broadway for a while, the losses from leaving would seem much starker than if you realized the entire city would be shut down with naught but sirens and furtive grocery shopping to bring life to the streets. A backyard beats a fire escape when you’re sheltering in place.


Capacity for adaptive change
============================

If you’re aware of the tidal wave coming, and you’re conveniently located at the bottom of the ladder to safety, are you healthy enough to get yourself up the ladder in time?

This is probably the wooliest of the factors, because it is hard to observe directly in others, but I believe people’s capacity for change varies. Personal experience with lifestyle change seemed to play a role in amplifying or exhausting people’s ability to undertake pandemic-driven change.

As a former consultant with hundreds of flights and hotel-nights behind me (including a few months in a northern mine camp), packing a suitcase and a laptop for indefinite travel to another country felt almost normal. I’ve lived in 4 cities in the last 5 years, and worked in a half dozen more. I’m used to rebuilding my life as needed wherever I end up.

In this instance, I don’t think capacity was a significant factor for many of my classmates in leaving the city. Almost by definition, these are people who are willing to make enormous financial bets (tuition, opportunity cost) and personal sacrifices (moving cities, time commitment) to pursue what they believe to be the right path for themselves.

But someone who had lived their whole life within a 100 mile radius might reach their limit in trying to move from the city to the suburbs, and I think this factor is even more important as we consider the lifestyle shifts required from all of us in adapting to physical distancing more broadly.


Results
=======

The Australian classmate who paid little attention to the virus and was planning a trip to Utah just days before he was juggling cancelled flights to get home to Melbourne. Low information responsiveness, but high capacity for change when the time came.

The classmate from the midwest who always raved about her hometown, and moved back home as soon as classes went remote, but at the sacrifice of leaving her husband temporarily with his parents. Good situational awareness, meaningful change required, but with change capacity built over years of juggling distance and work and grad school.

The 50% of my Family Business Management classmates who returned to their home countries. Regardless of their information flow, most had strong alternative options to NY and the financial and personal capacity to act on them.

Taken together, these factors seem to go some way in explaining the differences in migration decisions among my business school classmates (a group perhaps uniquely primed to move under these conditions), and reveal potentially useful factors for thinking through lifestyle changes in our eventual post-pandemic world.
