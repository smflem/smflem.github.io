  A recap of the books, movies, and performances that I experienced in 2022.

---

I’ve tracked the various books and performances that I’ve enjoyed throughout the last year. Works are listed below in the general order in which I read/watched them.

Previous editions: [2015](https://smflem.github.io/2016/01/10/2015_media_diet.html), [2016](https://smflem.github.io/2017/01/08/2016_media_diet.html), [2017](https://smflem.github.io/2018/01/06/2017_media_diet.html), [2018](https://smflem.github.io/2019/01/20/2018_media_diet.html), [2019](https://smflem.github.io/2020/01/01/2019_media_diet.html), [2020](https://smflem.github.io/2021/01/01/2020_media_diet.html), [2021](https://smflem.github.io/2022/01/01/2021_media_diet.html)

It was a significantly lighter year than usual in terms of book consumption. Some of this was a hectic travel schedule the first half of year and moving to California in the second half; some of this seems to have been starting (and not finishing) more books than usual.

2023 is off to a stronger start, though the relentless AI news does vie for attention.
