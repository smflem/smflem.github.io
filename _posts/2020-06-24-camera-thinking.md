Focus is a recurring challenge in my productive life. Given this, over the years I have rolled around many different metaphors for thinking / focusing, in an effort to 1) articulate how this feels subjectively 2) try to focus better / more readily.

These efforts have rarely amounted to much, but over time I've fumbled over and examined different potentially interesting models.

First, I gravitated towards a 'firehose' model. It can do an important job if pointed in the right direction, held firmly, and hooked up right. If left untethered it will generally end up harmlessly (or harmfully) spraying all over the place (see: [Jackass, Firehose Rodeo](https://youtu.be/44xb7xFLHAE)). That felt unsatisfying, if at least groping in the right direction. Later, I leaned towards a different mental frame, never particularly clear, involving a roving laser. Something about focusing lenses felt applicable, but this never really cohered.

Recently though, I've come upon a new model that's felt like a better fit, thinking about thinking in terms of a camera. This has a number of useful features.

First, this captures something important about *the environment*. Variance in light sources and lighting conditions have dramatic impacts on the usefulness of a camera, and the types of pictures that can be taken.

Snapping a selfie in Times Square is pretty straightforward. Given the electronic billboards, it's generally always well lit. You likely don't need to fiddle with your camera to get a good picture, your normal settings will take care of you. Given how iconic the location is, the photo need not be perfect for viewers to get the gist.

But taking a picture of the Milky Way requires a dark sky; during the day, the soft light of the stars are overwhelmed by the sun. Even at night, you'll need to get outside the light-polluted city and away from artificial light sources. Light you don't even notice with your naked eye will show up as an unseemly glow in your test shots. To have any hope of capturing light that's traversed a galaxy, a camera sensor should be shielded from unwanted stimulus.

Even then, you're results will likely be distorted by the moisture in the atmosphere, unless you've set your tripod in a [dry high altitude desert][Atacama_desert] (or are using [the Hubble Telescope][Hubble_Telescope]). At the extreme, sensor arrays designed to pick up neutrinos must be buried deep underground (or [in ice][IceCube]) to shield them from more energetic cosmic radiation. Otherwise the slight and fast neutrinos would melt into the background.

Second, this reveals the importance of one's own *'equipment'*.

If your camera has a narrow aperture, or a fixed (short) shutter speed, you will struggle to produce a useful Milky Way photo no matter how dark the sky. If your camera has a bulky telephoto lens, it will be hard to take a selfie in Times Square. If all you've got is a fisheye, all your photographs will be distorted (even if some will be interesting).

At the extreme, one can think again of the neutrino detector array IceCube. This likely takes a supremely shitty selfie, but it is spectacularly suited for its hyper-specific purpose. Knowing this is useful, to the extent that it leaves open the possibility of building a better camera, or at least one better suited to a specific purpose.

That said, for most of us, most of the time, the best camera is likely [the one you have with you][camera with you].

This especially shows the importance of *practice*.

With a wide-angle lens, my mirrorless camera can take decent photos of either Times Square or the Milky Way. But I need to know how to adjust its settings to get those results. I need to know how the shutter speed, the ISO, the aperture interact to avoid being washed out by billboards, or to keep the window open long enough for light from across the galaxy to wander in.

If I can vary my focal length, or change lenses entirely, I need to know what to use at what time to get a desired effect. In Times Square photography, light and location are table stakes, but it takes skill to know how to frame a shot to capture something interesting (and not just be a sad [insta_repeat][insta_repeat]).

All of these dimensions require practice, and training, to begin to develop an intuition around them. With the best camera in the world, one can guarantee serviceable if (likely) uninspiring pictures. But with the right sensibility, a Polaroid can be [a work of art][warhol_polaroid].

So going forward, using the camera metaphor as a lens to think about thinking surfaces the following questions:

1. What is the 'light level' in the environment? How does this suit what I'm trying to capture? Can I change what's hitting the sensor (e.g., through a lens hood, with a reflector)?

2. How do I need to use the camera / frame the shots, given what I want to capture? Do I take many quick shots to capture different angles (maybe because I'm not sure which will be best), or carefully mount a tripod for a precise long exposure?

3. What camera settings should I be using, given 1 and 2? Fast shutter, wide aperture to capture a fast moving subject? Slow shutter, high ISO to try to capture a dark scene?

While the ability of this metaphor (any metaphor) to fully capture the experience of thinking is necessarily limited, there's potentially a rich line of further pondering here.
