There are (at least) 3 big, transformational technologies areas that are reaching or at tipping points in their lifecycles. These are on the cusp of strong flywheel dynamics that will bring broad deployment, reduced costs, and increased capabilities, with concomitant transformations in material possibilities for humanity.

1.	Cheap **energy** in the form of solar photovoltaics

Thanks to a relentless learning curve, solar PV panels will continue to test new lows in price per watt. While there will be short-term blips in this trend, particularly in specific geographies (e.g., protectionist solar tariffs in the US), the continued deployment of this technology will incent competitive producers to keep pushing costs down. The implication here is that power at <$0.01 per kWh is achievable when the sun is shining. This is a great tailwind for solar project developers, but the real action will be in the use of this cheap power.

In the short term, this will be realized primarily in the form of batteries (e.g., utility-scale Lithium Iron Phosphate deployments, vehicle-to-grid / VPP schemes) that can arbitrage the price differential between sunny late afternoons and early evening peaks (along with providing other grid services like voltage / frequency regulation). Over the medium / long-term there will be significant value in finding ways to match energy-intensive processes to intermittent solar generation by reshaping them to ‘waste’ cheap energy and radically reduce associated capex to match lower utilization. [Terraform Industries](https://terraformindustries.com/) is one particularly cool instantiation of this thesis.

2.	Cheap **space access** in the form of SpaceX’s Starship

Thanks to a relentless team at SpaceX, the last 15 years have seen incredible progress in bringing down the cost of access to space (and rekindled the spacefaring ambitions of the world). Seriously, watch a video of a Falcon 9 landing and revel in the majesty and cost effectiveness. This has brought launch costs to LEO down from ~$xx per pound to ~$3,000-6,000 per kilogram. Arguably this has already been sufficient to saturate launch demand from payloads that are suited to Falcon 9’s capabilities, with much of the incremental capacity going to SpaceX’s Starlink constellation.

This will only get more pronounced when Starship becomes fully operational and reusable, precipitating further orders of magnitude reductions in cost per kg to LEO (and beyond). 100T is a lot of stuff to hurl into space all at once for ~$100M or less, and this will unlock opportunities to ‘waste’ weight in pursuit of expanded and new types of missions (e.g., true lunar or martian settlements, enormous space-based telescopes, orbital services with high delta-V tugs). 

Ignoring fairing limitations and assembly spacewalk time, reconstructing the ~450T ISS would take just 5 Starship launches at ~$0.1B each, versus the original ~36 Space Shuttle launches at ~$1.4B each.

3.	Cheap **intelligence** in the form of GenAI models

The accelerating cadence of AI model releases over the last ~18 months has unlocked access to near-human intelligence for pennies on the dollar. While there are significant long-term concerns about the potential capabilities of these systems, the short-term utility is clear. Processing and generating text and visual content at scale is here today. As many have noted, even if model progress stopped now there is a huge capability overhang that has yet to be deployed and realized within productive systems.

This is very much a case of the future being here, just not evenly distributed yet. The trivial example is this GPT wrapper which provides flirting suggestions based on chat screenshots; the scale example is integrating real-time support into every customer agent workflow globally (and replacing these roles once the systems become effective enough).

Across each of these tipping points, the near-term trend revolves around performing existing tasks at substantially lower costs. But the truly transformational changes will come from completely reworking processes and businesses to harness the new capabilities. This is where most of the value will be created, and likely captured. Exciting times we live in!

Other key trends that aren’t (necessarily) at tipping points:
-	Electric vehicles
    -   In a sense, the Tesla Model 3 / Y (and the Chinese equivalents) were already the tipping point. What we will see from here on is the steady march of further deployment, recent speed bumps notwithstanding, because the product is fundamentally better than ICE engines for most use cases (higher torque / acceleration, reduced ‘fuel’ costs, simplified maintenance)
-	MRNA vaccines
    -   COVID really provided the push to commercialize this technology at scale. Now comes the long (and hopefully fruitful) deployment of additional uses of this technology (e.g., in cancer treatment).
-	Flexible robotics
    -	Unlike the other two examples, this technology has likely not yet reached it’s tipping point. The use cases from existing capabilities remain too narrow to support the broad-based deployment that would unlock step changes in cost-reduction / further capabilities at scale. That said, industry activity in this areas (with tailwinds from AI and battery advances) could well bring a breakthrough.
