excerpt: |
  A list of potentially useful sources of information on technology businesses.
---

*The below was originally compiled in winter of 2022, when I was working for a tech-focused private equity fund as part of a retainer diligence team. The goal was to help our team, not all of whom had backgrounds in technology / technology companies, build knowledge (in parallel with our day-to-day work) by tapping into the flow of information being published on related topics. The team's focus, and the lean of the list, was towards Fintech / SaaS companies, but my hope is that this might also be useful as a more general compendium.*

High signal (for this team):
- [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) by Ben Thompson
  -  Likely most famous for his ‘[Aggregation theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/)’, the Weekly Update is free, and well worthwhile for broader technology analysis; [Beyond Disruption](https://stratechery.com/2015/beyond-disruption/) and [The Value Chain Constraint](https://stratechery.com/2019/the-value-chain-constraint/) may be of particular interest
  - A former colleague who now works in tech says, “Stratechery is an absolute must” and that the (paid) Daily Update is valuable, but I can’t speak to it personally

- A16Z [newsletters](https://info.a16z.com/newsletters.html)
  - Monthly collections of writing on enterprise tech, fintech, crypto (e.g., [CFO in Crisis Mode](https://a16z.com/2020/04/15/new-cfo-tools/), [Fintech scales vertical SaaS](https://future.a16z.com/fintech-scales-vertical-saas/), [Adding top-down sales](https://future.a16z.com/adding-top-down-sales/), [Crypto glossary](https://a16z.com/2019/11/08/crypto-glossary/))

- [Bits about Money](https://bam.kalzumeus.com/) by Patrick Mackenzie ([@patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11) on Twitter)
  - Relatively new newsletter from a prominent Stripe employee, focused on payments

<br>
<br>
Lower signal (high quality, lower avg. relevance):
- Kevin Kwok ([site](https://kwokchain.com/); [twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinakwok))
  - Infrequently published blog by a former Greylock analyst; known for memes on twitter and using [loops](https://twitter.com/kevinakwok/header_photo) as a framework in analysis
  - [The Mike Speiser Incubation Playbook](https://kwokchain.com/2020/09/22/the-mike-speiser-incubation-playbook/) and [Atomic Concepts](https://kwokchain.com/2021/02/05/atomic-concepts/) are two recent-ish posts of interest
- Reaction wheel by Jerry Neumann ([site](https://reactionwheel.net/))
  - Infrequently published blog by a thoughtful angel investor / Columbia professor; focus is on how to think about technology investing
  - [Productive uncertainty](https://reactionwheel.net/2020/11/productive-uncertainty.html) and [Taxonomy of moats](https://reactionwheel.net/2019/09/a-taxonomy-of-moats.html) may be of particular interest
- Colossus podcasts ([site](https://www.joincolossus.com/shows), weekly [newsletter](https://www.joincolossus.com/newsletter)) – Podcasts / transcripts on investing, startups, etc.
  - Invest Like the Best likely the most relevant, but all are potentially of interest if you prefer to get your info via podcasts
- Money Stuff by Matt Levine ([newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine); [twitter](https://twitter.com/matt_levine))
  - Daily finance-focused newsletter that is very well-written / intelligent, but not specifically relevant for our team or consulting more broadly
  - I read this most days, but this is admittedly more as entertainment than direct professional development
- Commoncog by Cedric Chin ([newsletter](https://commoncog.com/blog/subscribe-to-the-commonplace-newsletter/))
  - Weekly newsletter, focused on a range of topics including technology, w/ 1 article (free every other week) and 2-3 external links
  - I skim this each week and usually read ~1-2 of the linked pieces, but the specific hit rate for our team’s purposes will likely be low
  - [What Bill Gurley saw](https://commoncog.com/blog/what-bill-gurley-saw/) and [Product development as iterated taste](https://commoncog.com/blog/product-development-iterated-taste/) are of potential interest
- Eugene Wei ([site](https://www.eugenewei.com/))
  - Infrequently published personal blog of an early Amazon employee / exec at Hulu and Oculus / film school dropout; more social / consumer tech focused, but very thoughtful if that’s your bag
  - [Invisible Asymptotes](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes) and his series on TikTok are interesting, [Remove the legend to become one](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/11/13/remove-the-legend) is a funny riff on line chart design
- Dan Wang ([site](https://danwang.co/about/))
  - Infrequently published personal blog of a China technology analyst for Gavekal Dragonomics
  - [Definite optimism as human capital](http://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/) is a great piece that confirms my bias that science fiction is world-expanding; [How technology grows](https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/) is the shorter version

  <br>
  <br>
Lower signal (lower avg. quality, lower avg. relevance):
- Hacker News ([site](https://news.ycombinator.com/))
  - Aggregation of links, generally things of interest to those working in technology, often more technical-minded than ‘news’ sites
  - Potentially worth a recurring skim if you’re interested in technology more generally
  - I skim the link headlines most days, and often read 1 or 2 things that look interesting
- Techcrunch ([site](https://techcrunch.com/))
  - Coverage of startups / funding rounds completed / VC activity, but pretty noisy
  - I skim the headlines most days, but not sure how much value I get from that
- FT Alphaville ([sub-site](https://www.ft.com/alphaville))
  - Free-with-account blog from the FT; well-written, idiosyncratic pieces on finance and its edges
  - I used to read this regularly, but haven’t in recent years; potentially worthwhile if you like what you’re getting from Matt Levine
