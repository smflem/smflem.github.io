Over the last 18 months, the private equity industry has come under increasing scrutiny within the United States for the alleged ill effects it has caused across the economy, in particular for its role in the high profile collapses of companies like Toys R Us, Payless Shoes, and most recently the news outlet Deadspin. Even among this group, the recent meltdown of Deadspin was remarkable for both its speed and highly public nature. Yet critics and advocates alike often mistake how private equity funds attempt to create value through their acquisitions, and the role their historical success has had in creating their current issues.

For an industry long accustomed to praise within business circles, and only vague ambivalence among the broader public, private equity’s newfound fame is unhelpful at best and potentially fatal at worst, given some of the more extreme proposed regulatory remedies to its perceived shortcomings. Even among industry participants, there is growing recognition of the limitations in existing PE models to create value, given increased competition for deals and the resulting inflation in asset prices since the financial crisis.

Yet public discussion of private equity have often failed to integrate these various perspectives, leaving material gaps in popular understanding of the industry. Ultimately, these gaps risk a misdirected and poorly calibrated regulatory reaction that destroys the sector’s potential to support economic dynamism without fixing its very real underlying issues.

In particular, there is often disagreement about whether and how private equity firms add value through their work, especially due to the diversity of strategies and overall opacity of the industry. But in taking the evolution of the industry as a whole, from its emergence as a force in the 1980’s to present day, consistent patterns begin to emerge.

Initially known as leveraged buyouts for the then-novel high yield debt they employed, in the 1980’s private equity firms mainly added value by creating urgency at the companies they acquired[^1].

One archetypical example from these early years was the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. (KKR). As the 1993 HBO movie Barbarians at the Gate captured, RJR Nabisco was then a bloated conglomerate making everything from Oreos to cigarettes, with spendthrift executives and no clear strategic direction. Even at a purchase price of $25 billion, at the time the largest buyout in history, KKR was able to earn a significant return through basic steps like selling off the corporate jets, spinning off non-core divisions, and renewing focus on the main business (with incentive packages to match for senior management).

This initial model of private equity mostly prioritized helping companies do what they ‘should’ be doing but weren’t thanks to misaligned incentives or a lack of strategic focus. Perhaps the current CEO cared more about his vanity projects or his mistress than his shareholders, or division heads spent their time growing their fiefdoms and fighting amongst themselves, or the potential of a business unit went unnoticed and underexploited by a hulking parent company.

In these cases, a PE firm could add value by acquiring the company in question and putting simple measures in place to increase management urgency and focus on profitability. Common tools to achieve this included: strongly tying compensation to performance goals for top management, providing a level of active oversight not achievable through the public markets or corporate ownership, taking on debt in part to force focus on the core business and meet regular debt payments. All of these serve to keep management focused on doing what they theoretically should have been doing all along. As the TV movie version of Henry Kravis put it, “Debt can be an asset. Debt tightens a company.”

Yet these levers only add value to the extent that a company isn’t already focused and urgent. This was the case in the 1980’s when the strategy was new, but funds have been pursuing this playbook for decades now. The stock of bloated companies lazily combining meatpacking and pharmaceuticals has long since dwindled. At the same time, business education and management expertise, at least to a basic level, have become more evenly distributed across the economy through the increasing popularity of business administration degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level.

This leaves fewer obvious candidates for increased urgency alone, where the correct strategy is widely known but not executed. And in cases of strategic ambiguity, increased urgency can simply accelerate disaster as predictably as launching a rocket indoors. Indeed private equity is often criticized for enabling a sort of hyper-capitalism where both bad and good outcomes are merely accelerated without any real improvement, except that a PE fund is now skimming value off the top.

So while the creation of urgency remains a core tool for private equity funds, its commoditization in recent decades has increasingly forced funds to attempt to improve the strategic direction of their portfolio companies, in an effort to add incremental value relative to public markets and relative to their peers.

This type of opportunity follows from the uneven distribution of management expertise and ability. Take a hypothetical manufacturing company based in Wichita. It is a leader in its niche, but perhaps it can’t afford to attract top executives or engineers. Because of its relative geographic isolation, it struggles to stay connected to the latest trends that affect its business. While these business practices and ideas will eventually reach it as they spread throughout the economy, the delay means lost value for the company and its owners.

But an equally hypothetical private equity fund based in New York has the financial incentive through its concentrated ownership stake to spread knowledge to and improve the strategic direction of its portfolio companies. The fund will add value to the extent this new knowledge or new strategic direction makes the company more profitable over the long term.

Due to the commodification of urgency and basic strategy, this type of advanced support has become increasingly important since the original LBO boom in the ‘80s. Many funds have accordingly built out internal teams focused specifically on portfolio company improvement, though the level of support can still vary widely. In a talk at Columbia Business School, one PE managing director described “the increasingly tight linkage between investment and operational decisions” as a way for PE funds to continue to add value, and to differentiate between each other.

While this may earn a return for PE funds and their investors, this mechanism is not always an unalloyed good for society more broadly. Given the many flaws of extant capitalism, the spread of ‘better’ strategic thinking can in practice be harmful for a company, its stakeholders, or for society as a whole. As anti-monopoly advocate Matt Stoller put it, “PE firms serve as transmitters of information across businesses, sort of disease vectors for price gouging and legal arbitrage.”

From a fund’s perspective as well, this can be a challenging thing to pull off consistently. Similar to the case for urgency, any new information or strategic direction must be unavailable to the company or other potential owners for the private equity firm to be uniquely useful. And again, since many funds have been working to do this for many years, most obvious sources of advantage have been competed away. The result is that continued success often requires deep specialization on the part of funds to navigate the required strategic tradeoffs.

This is where Deadspin’s owners appear to have faltered. Great Hill Partners, the fund that acquired Deadspin along with a number of other media properties, and Jim Spanfeller, the executive brought in from Forbes.com to run Deadspin, appear to have believed that existing management was forgoing clear opportunities to improve profitability through increased ad load and increased focus on driving page views. They felt the road to increased profitability was obvious, if only there were “adults in the room” to guide management there.

But especially in today’s challenging media environment, strategic choices like these almost always require tradeoffs to be effective. A focus on clickbait and ad load pose a distinct choice against wide-ranging, thoughtful journalism aimed at driving time on site. Based on the strong internal outcry against their strategy, GHP and Spanfeller appear to have underestimated how radical and non-obvious their set of strategic choices felt to many at Deadspin. By not clearly understanding the strategic tradeoffs involved, and how to work with existing employees to navigate them, GHP risked destroying a previously effective business and the value of its investment.

This and other recent private equity failures are evidence, at least in part, of the risks involved in a PE model based around strategic improvement. Though in theory PE funds can add value in this way, this requires strongly differentiated expertise or a novel strategic insight to be effective.

With money flowing in from pension funds and asset managers around the world, PE funds appear to be struggling to find deals that fit these requirements. In 2019, committed but un-invested funds, known as ‘dry powder’, reached a new record of $2.0 trillion according to a report by Bain & Company. As reported by Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley Wealth CIO Lisa Shalett put it this way, “We think we have a reached a peak in the private-equity market. Investors tempted to chase the double-digit returns that many earned in private investment vehicles this past decade need to downgrade their expectations. The environment for private investing has gotten tougher.”

The result is an increasingly competitive environment, where high valuations require funds to deepen their sector and strategic expertise, while also considering increasingly radical strategic choices in order to generate returns. While this will be effective in many cases, the sheer scale of modern private equity means that there will also be many more failures like Deadspin, especially as more money flows in from pension funds desperate to boost their own returns.

These radical strategic attempts and inevitable failures are likely to continue to attract scrutiny of the industry. Unfortunately, this may be an unavoidable outcome of private equity funds trying to scale to deploy their ever larger cash piles effectively. Until private equity funds are able to identify a third engine of value creation beyond urgency and strategic improvement, they will thus remain vulnerable to calls to rein in the industry.

And ultimately no new sources of value may be forthcoming. If so, the PE industry might finally succumb to the negative claims long lobbed at it. As former Morgan Stanley banker Barton Bigg’s famously put it, “There is no asset class too much money can’t spoil.”
