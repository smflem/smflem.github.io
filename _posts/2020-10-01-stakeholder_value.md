title:  "Stakeholder governance is still far off"

In recent years, much has been made of the need to move beyond shareholder value maximization as a guiding corporate principle. The reappraisals of business's proper role in society have been perhaps most pronounced in the US, where the breakdown in federal lawmaking has left corporations (and corporate and securities law) as one of the few functioning loci for addressing the country's manifest challenges.

For example, see the [plaintiff lawsuits][levine_exxon] against firms like Exxon that hope to drive incremental / punitive action against firms contributing most directly to climate change. Or the recent controversy over [rulemaking][levine_pension_esg] by the Department of Labor to keep ESG-focused funds *out* of retirement savings plans for considering non-economic factors, a reaction to the rapid rise of ESG and other purportedly socially beneficial investments.

In this context, the recent swell in support for a stakeholder governance model, one that purports to consider more than just profit in its ambitions, is perhaps unsurprising.

In their memo ['On the Purpose of the Corporation'][wlrk_corp_purpose], lawyers of Wachtell Lipton Rosen Kratz outline a relatively coherent prospective definition of corporate goals potentially consistent with this new regime:
>The purpose of a corporation is to conduct a lawful, ethical, profitable and sustainable business in order to create value over the long-term, which requires consideration of the stakeholders that are critical to its success (shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, creditors and communities), as determined by the corporation and the board of directors using its business judgment and with regular engagement with shareholders, who are essential partners in supporting the corporationâ€™s pursuit of this mission.

Since this might seem obvious (or at least unobjectionable), it's worth outlining the baseline this is pushing against. For decades, the popular understanding of shareholder value maximization has been underpinned by 2 things: Milton Friedman and Delaware corporate law.

Despite his Nobel prize and extensive public career, Friedman is perhaps most widely remembered now for his [1970 article][friedman_responsibility] in New York Times Magazine that argued "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits". To baldly summarize, Friedman argued that 1) as agents of shareholders, business executives had no license to pursue social responsibility and 2) if they tried, they would be bad at it. While these arguments have been frequently criticized[^1] and reexamined over the years (including alongside the recent [50th anniversary of the essay][nyt_friedman_50]), the basic substance has nonetheless embedded itself in the corporate firmament.

In many ways the pithy title itself has had the most staying power. Skimpily caveated&mdash;
with the arguments purported to hold "so long as [corporations] stay within the rules of the game"&mdash;
this idea of profits as overriding goal has endured for a half-century in the public consciousness.

And Delaware corporate law, and associated jurisprudence, has often been cited as the structural inertia complementing this memetic endurance. Here the focus is usually on the concept of fiduciary duty[^2], and the associated constraints it may (or may not) place on boards and executives in pursuing goals other than shareholder value maximization.

On the one hand, legal rulings like [*Revlon*][revlon_wikipedia] posit that directors must focus only on ["getting the best price for the stockholders"][revlon_opinion]. This standard, in force only in specific change-of-control situations, is often implied more broadly to support the singular pursuit of profits. Further, under the theory of 'shareholder primacy', directors and executives, as agents of shareholders, do have [real duties][skadden_fiduciary] to act in the best interest of shareholders, which has been [interpreted][skadden_social_responsibility] to mean promoting the economic value of the corporation for stockholders.

While this may seem to preclude any meaningful shift towards stakeholder governance, law firms like [Wachtell Lipton][wlrk_fiduciary] and [Skadden Arps][skadden_social_responsibility] have argued that the legal concept of 'business judgment' provides ample cover for board and executive decision-making that values stakeholders, so long as they can be interpreted to be pursuing long-term value creation for shareholders.

Given this starting point, how could the stakeholder governance model propose to improve long-term value[^3] creation:

1. *As a way to move towards a pareto value frontier:* Given a historic focus on 'shareholder value maximization', corporations may be sacrificing cheap improvements for being '[paper clip][lw_paperclip] [maximizers][ted_chiang]' obsessed with profits in the short term. Corporations are creatures of society, and an increased focus on employees, customers and communities could reasonably be argued to actually create incremental value for the corporation over the long term (by making human society more productive). In this model, shareholders are neutral / better off with stakeholder governance. This [doesn't violate][skadden_social_responsibility] shareholder primacy per se, but privileges an all-encompassing view of how to achieve shareholder's economic interests.

2. *As a way to move along a pareto value frontier:* This more radical view posits that a transfer of profits from one group (shareholders) to others (workers, customers, communities) would be a net creation of value for society through movement along the (non-linear) value frontier. Think [guns vs. butter][guns_butter]. This relies on the thesis that, far from diminishing overall efficiency through weakened incentives (and a resulting shift off the frontier), a reduction in shareholder power and profit will lead to greater human flourishing overall. This is often not stated this bluntly, but I've found it can get conflated with #1 in lay conversation, especially outside the business community. Because it represents an un-recaptured transfer from shareholders to stakeholders, this is of questionable legality under existing corporate law (at least if justified as such).

3. *As a move away from the pareto value frontier:* This is basically an even more extreme version of #2, a transfer of value from shareholders to stakeholders. Shareholders (capitalists) control the means of production and capture unfair rents at the expense of their employees, their customers and their communities. Thus, arguably there is moral value in seizing more of that value for other stakeholders, even if the resulting network of relations leads to a decline in overall efficiency. While this may sound extreme or unrealistic (and almost certainly unsupported in Delaware corporate law), similar principles crop up in discussions of anti-trust / monopoly law. While a single water utility may be the most resource-efficient for a given city, left unconstrained it could capture more rent than we as a society have decided fair, with this rent unlikely to incentivize incremental efficiency[^4]. Thus these types of organizations are often regulated to cap the profits available to shareholders, even if this disincentivizes efficiency / profit improvements on the margin and thus reduces overall value created.

As might be expected from those grounded in corporate law, the definition of corporate purpose outlined by Wachtell Lipton above adheres primarily to theory #1, and in holding with 'shareholder primacy' maintains that a shift towards stakeholder governance can improve long-term value creation for shareholders. On the other hand, the Business Roundtable [pronouncement][brt_announcement] of last year, vague as it is, ostensibly sits much closer to #2. This includes a sub-heading announcing a move "away from shareholder primacy" (that BRT endorsed in 1997) and towards a more equal weighting of the needs of all stakeholders as stakeholders (and not merely as instruments of long-term value for shareholders). This second definition drew understandable pushback from trade groups like the [Council of Institutional Investors][cii_response] that exist to advocate for the interests of shareholders.

Unfortunately, for those hoping to see meaningful change from this softening stance of corporate executives, in line with any of the theories outlined above, there is little evidence this shift is (yet) trickling down to where it's actually needed.

First, as folks like [Matt Levine][levine_1] [have][levine_2] [entertainingly][levine_3] [pointed][levine_4] [out][levine_5], because of the structure of oversight for executives (and to a lesser extent boards) the *mechanism* and *effect* of a shift from shareholder primacy to stakeholder governance is to weaken oversight of executives and boards, through handing them incremental authority to use their 'business judgment' to determine what is best for 'stakeholders'. As the CII [argues][cii_response], "accountability to everyone means accountability to no one".

There has been some early academic consideration of this shift, with the findings not entirely heartening. One piece of [research][wsj_brt_boards] found that many signatories to the Business Roundtable's statement, ostensibly committing themselves and their firms to a major change in governance priorities, had not received approval from their boards of directors (let alone shareholders) prior to the statement's release.

A more [in-depth study][illusory_promise] from the same authors ([summary slides here][illusory_slides]) uses acquisition data from jurisdictions that explicitly allow (or even require) consideration of stakeholder needs to show that these values are rarely if ever observed in practice. They further argue that the structure of incentives for boards and for executives fails to support this shift towards "stakeholderism", thus making any material shift in this direction unlikely. They argue that a focus on stakeholder governance *within* existing corporate governance is a dead end that could even detract from real attempts at change.

Some like Wachtell Lipton [retort][wlrk_board_memo] that these firms will remain ultimately accountable to shareholders; "the practical reality is that asset managers and institutional investors continue to be uniquely situated to exert tremendous influence and pressure on public corporations". Yet this defense upholds the idea of shareholder primacy that seems to be at issue in so many arguments for stakeholder governance.

This does not mean that stakeholder governance is impossible, nor that all attempts towards such are primarily cynical or self-serving. Rather, significant ongoing effort will be required to make a shift in corporate governance this foundational. It will likely not succeed if driven by existing incentive systems for shareholders, boards of directors, and executives. Without outside pressure from governments or other non-market actors, real progress here will likely be slow.

So, where does that leave us?

Change will be unavoidably messy. Much of modern financial capitalism constitutes a structure of abstraction&mdash;from raw business activity of producing goods and delivering services up through managerial control systems, financial accounting and reporting for public markets that then constitute indexes, overseen by vast asset managers ostensibly on behalf of individual savers. In this, the commonly shared goal of economic profit is an incredibly useful coordinating mechanism. Unwinding or reworking this structure of abstraction will be hard and complicated and time consuming.

And at their root, many of the values of different stakeholders are as yet incommensurable. It has been at least 700 years since humanity started refining modern [double entry bookkeeping][double_entry_bookkeeping]; it took IFRS [15 years][nyt_leases] to update lease accounting standards following Enron's collapse; we should not expect a quick and painless shift towards valuing a plurality of competing endpoints. Many of these have traditionally been the purview of power and politics, not easily mediated through the crude-but-effective common currency of money and self-interest. Though I am less cynical than Friedman on whether corporate leaders can learn to judge these tradeoffs effectively, I don't underestimate the additional information and tools and processes and incentives that will be required to do so.

Ultimately, reformers may find it more expedient to route changes *through* the profit motive (through e.g., carbon pricing, anti-monopoly legislation) rather than to rework the fundament of corporate governance itself.

No matter what shape change ultimately takes, there is growing appetite for a new bargain between corporations and citizens, and this is unlikely to remain unaddressed.

[^1]: Aside from the bombastic nature of the whole thing, Friedman's position relies fundamentally on the presence of complete, efficient markets with ample and effective competition (governed by an effective regulatory regime). This is, suffice to say, not a defensible assumption in practice (see, for example: Grossman-Stiglitz, the need for antitrust law, and the existence of regulatory capture).

[^2]: There is a literature here, one that I am only superficially familiar with. Bear with me.

[^3]: Throughout, I will unfortunately conflate profits and value. Defining these terms, and translating between them across the different parties discussed, would imply a clarity in usage that is lacking in this debate and in fact contributes to the ambiguity discussed.

[^4]: I've chosen water as a utility because of the relatively slow historical rate of progress in the industry. With telecoms or electric utilities, there is a stronger argument to be made that capping profits dulls the striving for innovation and adoption of new technologies that could ultimately expand the value frontier. Unfortunately, this is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy in my experience, with many water utilities constitutionally disinclined to adopt potential innovations that might introduce risk or costs into their systems, as there is rarely any upside in it for them.
