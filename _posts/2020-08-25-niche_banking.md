In research for a [previous post](https://smflem.github.io/2019/12/15/tax-equity.html) on tax equity structures in renewable energy, I was surprised that the investment bankers I talked to were unfazed or even supportive of the imminent tax credit phaseout. At the time, this was frankly shocking to me, motivating the research that led to the article.

Tax equity structures are weird. There's a good explainer from the Congressional Research Service [here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45693.pdf), but suffice to say these deals were often facilitated by specialist advisors (e.g., CohnReznick Capital) and marketed to specialist investors with specific tax minimization strategies(e.g., other banks)

Putting aside the climate change implications, why were these market experts--shepherds of the complex financing structures required to get renewable energy projects developed before cost parity was reached--so keen to see their clients' financing needs get simpler?

The bankers I spoke with justified their support with expectations of greater deal flow and lower capital costs after the tax credits were eliminated. The achievement of cost parity, along with the broader push to combat climate change, meant money was increasingly rushing into the sector and these dealmakers were salivating at the prospective opportunities.

This highlights a strategic oversight I hear frequently in lay discourse: That rapid industry growth is an obvious good thing for incumbents.

In my opinion the rapid expansion, and especially simplification, of financing for renewable energy projects could in fact lead to the diminishment of the specialist banks and facilitators that have so far been protected by barriers to entry and benefitted from the maturation of the industry.

In particular, the growth in the sector will make it worthwhile for non-specialist banks to invest and build out their teams and expertise to compete here. The product simplification through the phaseout of tax equity structures will only make this easier. The result will be heightened competition for incumbents, and likely an erosion of their previous positions.

The long tail of generic pharmaceuticals manufacturing provides a usefully simplified illustration of this effect.

After a drug goes off-patent, other manufacturers can spin up operations to produce and distribute the drug, often selling at a discount to the branded price before patent expiry. This can be great for patients, with even [larger price cuts](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/generic-competition-and-drug-prices) observed when multiple generic producers enter.

But entry is costly, requiring highly specialized facilities be set up prior to an uncertain regulatory approval process. As a result, drugs that treat a small or specialized patient population might see few or even no generic entrants.

To make this a little more concrete, lets imagine a foot fungus that afflicts ~10,000 Americans annually, with a patented and branded remedy currently priced at $110. Because it only costs $10 to produce the remedy, the branded manufacturer sees a gross profit of ~$1M per year. If we assume this could continue in perpetuity, with a 5% discount rate this product is currently worth ~$20M to the manufacturer.

It's about to go off-patent, and a generic manufacturer is considering entry. They estimate it will cost them ~$10M to attempt entry. Based on past experience (and [FDA research](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/generic-competition-and-drug-prices)), they figure they can get ~50% share if they price at ~60% of the branded price, resulting in an expected gross profit of ~$280,000 per year. Unfortunately, even if assumed in perpetuity, when discounted at 5% this is only worth ~$5.6M today. This is not enough to justify the $10M investment to enter.

Worse, if the incumbent does this same math they'll realize they can actually increase their price by >60% to ~$180 per patient while still being insulated from competition. It's [this logic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-genericdrugs-specialization/analysis-small-generic-drug-firms-need-niches-to-survive-looming-price-war-idUSBRE86J0ZI20120720), not the inherent villainy of people like [Martin Shkreli](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html), that drove much of the highly publicized and highly criticized price increases in niche pharmaceuticals in recent years.

Our model pharmaceutical market can't support a single new competitor when entry costs $10M to access just 10,000 potential patients. But if the number of potential patients grows to 40,000, and entry costs fall to $5M, suddenly 3 new competitors become viable.

This is what is happening right now in renewable energy financing; the market is growing and financing is being simplified. For the world and its fight against climate change, this is an unalloyed good, and can't happen fast enough. But the competitive result, I expect, will be increased competition from non-specialist banks and a potential erosion of the competitive position of specialist firms.

So while overall deal flow might increase, and financing rates could stay low thanks to an influx of new capital, if I ran a specialist investment bank focused on renewable energy I would not be so sanguine about the tax equity phaseout's effects on my business.
