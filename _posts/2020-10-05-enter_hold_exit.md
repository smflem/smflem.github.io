One way to think about investor ability, and business ability more generally, is to break it down into three phases of activity:
1. Enter
2. Hold
3. Exit


**Enter**

Enter is, generally, the sexy one. This is historically where most investors have focused; the Buy Low of Buy Low/ Sell High.

To my mind, there are 2 broad components of of Entering well:
1. Identifying undervalued assets
2. Buying them

Both of these can be quite hard! Modern financial markets (especially in developed countries) can be brutally competitive. The relative ease of buying on public markets in particular mean there are many people working to identify and close financial mispricings. Where these mispricings seem to persists, the underlying gap often turns out to be a 'limit to arbitrage' story--the asset is hard to buy in a way that preserves its 'undervalued' status.

So how do investors create / capture value here?

In public markets, the main focus is on identifying mispricings. While trade execution is non-trivial (particularly when moving into large positions), most public markets investors are taking minority stakes and will differentiate themselves less by buying well. The exception here is those investors seeking to purchase controlling stakes in a company, in which the arcane dance of toeholds and tender offers creates room for experts to buy better than the uninitiated.

Private markets often involve a mix of both factors, unsurprising given the myriad diversity contained with the term 'private markets'. On the margin, 'mispricings' can be more common, but often as a direct result of the increased friction of transacting. If you're a PE fund, you might aim to create / capture value by generating proprietary deal-flow (e.g., by being the partner of choice for a management buyout) or through multiple arbitrage (e.g., by buying a number of smaller businesses and bolting them together such that their increased size makes them tractable for public market investors). You're likely trying to avoid auctions whenever possible (good luck with that), or potentially grinding a deal price down once in exclusive talks (though this can have reputational impacts for repeate players).

As we reach venture capital and even seed-stage investments, the current expected value of an asset becomes increasingly probabilistic. While valuations are usually still calculated, in recent years capital has been cheap and investors have focused on falling over themselves to be founder-friendly. Investors create / capture value for themselves by identifying promising startups ahead of competitors (e.g., by developing feeder networks of lawyers, tax accountants, seed investors; by specializing in a technology or sector), and convincing startups to take funding from them and not the next undifferentiated sack of capital (e.g., by building a brand or support organization that attracts high-quality founders (either as inbound, or as a differentiator in competitive situations)).

The example that actualy kicked off this line of thinking is Warren Buffett. Warren publicly eschews meddling with Hold and Exit. Berkshire Hathaway has a lean head office, and gives its portfolio companies significant leeway to operate (with oversight of capital deployment). Ostensibly, they're content to never Exit winning investments. All the seeming edge comes from Entering well. Buffett is notorious for avoiding auctions, disparaging sell-side bankers, and leveraging his folksy image to the hilt to generate proprietary deal-flow. True to form, he monetized this reputation in 2008 with a sweetheart deal for ~$5B in preferred shares in  Goldman Sachs.


**Hold**

Activity levels differ a lot here across different types of owners.

On one end of the spectrum are passive public index investors. They hold the market and don't aim to create / capture any differential value in their holdings. The goal is to get market exposure as cheaply as possible, not exert effort meddling. On the other end of the spectrum are control investors like private equity firms that purchase majority stakes in entire companies. They often come in with a specific thesis on how to make the company more valuable under their ownership, and will execute on that vision. They have no qualms about directing the strategy and key decisions of a portfolio company, often replacing key executives and orchestrating follow-on acquisitions. 

Activist investors and venture capitalists often sit somewhere in the middle. The former will often agitate for changes of strategy, or increases in buybacks (to return capital to shareholders since existing management can't be trusted not to waste it), and angle for seats on a companies board to help ensure their recommendations are carried out.  VCs will often get board seats as part of their investment, and provide support to their portfolio companies to increase their chances of exiting successfully. In both cases though, activists and VCs tend to be minority holders and influence companies by convincing others to go along (e.g., by convincing public shareholders to vote alongside them, by convincing majority-owner founders that without agreeing to a pivot / down round their company will fail and their equity will be worthless).

One interesting niche here is the rise of active credit funds that understand there's a good chance they'll end up owning an asset for a potential turnaround. In the same vein, one can aesthetically appreciate 'normal' bond funds trading out of distressed sovereign debt to let someone like Elliot Singer do the hard work of seizing Argentinian naval vessels.

In recent years, there has been seeming _polarization_ of approaches here, with increasing share of funds held by passive indexers and low-touch 'founder-friendly' VCs seeming to get better deal flow, while at the same time control investors like PE funds bulk up their 'value creation' teams and some VCs standing up support orgs to help their portfolio companies. I expect this trend to continue, with not always great results (one example of which I outlined in my piece on [Deadspin and Private Equity]).


**Exit**

This does not usually get the same airtime as the sexier job of Enter. Some studies of portfolio managers have even found that randomly exiting would be better than the exit decisions actually made, implying that this area could deserve more focus. Selling high is just as important as buying low.

My reading of different exit decisions is that there are 2 relevant sub-skills here: timing and execution.

Timing is likely obvious, but it can encompass many different forms.
- PE selling after their changes show benefits, but while runway exists for further growth
- Hedge fund selling ahead of market based on a unique alternative data resource
- Martha Stewart selling ahead of bad news thanks to her broker

Timing may be obvious, but that doesn't mean it's easy. "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent", etc. Being early (or late) is as bad as being wrong.

Forced exits can be incredibly expensive, and should be avoided to the extent possible. These are the stuff crises are made of:
- Margin calls lead to fire sales
- Unexpected estate tax liabilities above available liquidity (forcing the sale of e.g. a family business)
- Nationalization / expropriation of assets

Execution of an exit can also be critical, though often falls to the basic blocking and tackling of finance:
- Good traders to avoid moving the market when unloading a position (or well-connected to get a bank to do a block trade at a good price)
- Good lawyers to mitigate the damage of exiting through bankruptcy
- PE portfolio ops team to help prep companies for a sale process
- Good bankers to run a sale process

Get this right and you too can ride off into the sunset; get it wrong and you end up holding the bag.
