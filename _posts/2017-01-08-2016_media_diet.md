Similar to my [2015](https://smflem.github.io/2016/01/10/2015_media_diet.html) effort, I’ve tracked the various movies, albums and books that I’ve enjoyed throughout last year. Works are listed below in the general order in which I read/watched them.

If you’re looking for specific recommendations, a few gems slightly off the beaten path are:

Book — Red Plenty by Francis Spufford
Movie — Kubo and the Two Strings (Amnesiac beetle samurai is the role McConaughey was born to play)
Album — Quack by Duck Sauce

TL; DR — I read and watched a bunch of stuff last year. Looking for thoughtful recommendations for 2017.
