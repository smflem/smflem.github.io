*Retrospectively posted in June 2021 in an effort for completeness*

I’ve tracked the various books, movies, and performances that I’ve enjoyed throughout the last year. Works are listed below in the general order in which I read/watched them.

Previous editions: [2015](https://smflem.github.io/2016/01/10/2015_media_diet.html), [2016](https://smflem.github.io/2017/01/08/2016_media_diet.html), [2017](https://smflem.github.io/2018/01/06/2017_media_diet.html), [2018](https://smflem.github.io/2019/01/20/2018_media_diet.html), [2019](https://smflem.github.io/2020/01/01/2019_media_diet.html)

If you’re looking for specific recommendations, a few gems slightly off the beaten path are:

Book — Barn 8 by Deb Olin Unferth (chicken heist!)
Performance — Cambodian Rock Band (if it gets re-staged)

Always looking for more thoughtful recommendations.
