  A short recap of the books I read surrounding Fukuyama's 'End of History'.
---

Alongside Fukuyama's book The End of History and the Last Man (discussed here), I read a cluster of books that I thought might provide interesting related arguments and perspectives, and answer some of the questions raised by Fukuyama. Each of these books is listed below with a small blurb outlining the most relevant points.

***Selected questions for follow-on books:***

- How useful is the 'struggle for recognition' as a frame for understanding non-economic human behavior?
- How do people shape identity (how do they demonstrate thymos) in a post-historical society (e.g., as potential bourgeois)
- How much are current populist convulsions really about the struggle for recognition? Recognition as humans? Part of broader (more hierarchical) status games?
- How important are relevant wealth / consumption disparities vs. absolute in modern society?
- How does the lack of broadly understood moral values (e.g., historical Christian values) undermine our ability to cohere and sustain as a community? Is this, in practice, being undermined by liberal values for tolerance?
- Are efforts being made to construct a new set of moral values against which we can test one's humanity?
- What outlets for megalothymia might exist outside those proffered by Fukuyama (Economic activity, democratic politics, formal activities)? What outlets exist for positive sum human striving?
  -  What about 'The Destiny' as described in Octavia Butler's 'Parable' series? "The destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars"



***Clustered reading:***

[**The End of History and the Last Man**](https://www.amazon.ca/End-History-Last-Man/dp/0743284550/) <br>
_Francis Fukuyama_ <br>
Liberal democracy and capitalism seem like the best system for recognizing and leveraging people's unique humanness, but may ultimately struggle to be sustainable: some people just want to be better than others (megalothymia) and may be unsatisfied without an outlet; reliance on tolerance as the ultimate virtue undermines itself and the 'pre-liberal' value systems that made liberal democracy possible; people may seek struggle for struggle's sake. Only time will tell if this is the destination towards which all societies are headed.

[**The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia**](https://www.amazon.ca/Grasshopper-Third-Games-Life-Utopia/dp/1554812151/) <br>
_Bernard Suits_ <br>
Games are one way to (safely) maintain a megalothymotic hierarchy, and therefore constitute the core activity in an eventual Utopia. "Playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles". Games are inherently, fundamentally inefficient; inefficiency in means to achieve a stated prelusory goal may indicate game-like activity (though perhaps closer to the 'con' of Byrne's 'Games People Play').

[**What About Me? The Struggle for Identity in a Market-Based Society**](https://www.amazon.ca/What-about-Me-struggle-market-based/dp/1922070904/) <br>
_Paul Verhaeghe_ <br>
Contra the potential recession of values (due to tolerance / equality) posited by Fukuyama, Verhaeghe argues (in a roundabout way) that people _need_ value systems to function. We've simply replaced prior value systems with neo-liberal / capitalist values, with the concomitant elevation of consumption, productivity, and 'successes'. This makes economic failure pathological / deviant, creating pressure on individuals to attribute failure to non-agentic causes (e.g., mental illness, racism, sexism) in a bid for self-esteem / status despite failure in the prevailing value system. NB: This book was the weakest in this cluster.

[**Amusing Ourselves to Death**](https://www.amazon.ca/Amusing-Ourselves-Death-Discourse-Business/dp/014303653X/) <br>
_Neil Postman_ <br>
Fukuyama asserted that education underpinned the recognition of mass equality that drove the demand for and shift towards liberal democracy. Shift from typography to television elevates entertainment and impressionist emotionality over analytical thought, seeming rather than being, and risks undermining that shared sense of individual dignity / humanness. Walter Lippman (1920) "There can be no liberty for a community which lacks the ability to detect lies."

[**Dignity**](https://www.amazon.ca/Dignity-Seeking-Respect-Back-America/dp/0525534733/) <br>
_Chris Arnade_ <br>
Mainstream American society judges / values: economic success, education / credentials. Marginalized (culturally excluded) people broadly fail to conform / perform these values, because the signalling measures are hierarchal, constrained (gated), and often favor incumbents. End up building alternative values / communities around: place, faith, race, drug use. These are less hierarchal and more inclusive, and viewed as 'backwards' to the extent they contradict mainstream economic / credentialed values. Still, these people are people and demand / deserve dignity and respect qua humans.

[**The Complacent Class**](https://www.amazon.ca/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691/) <br>
_Tyler Cowen_ <br>
In our success, we have sought comfort and stability, but this very stability has resulted in a decreasingly dynamic / increasingly balkanized society that is merely holding off discontinuous change (akin to tension building in an earthquake fault line); we have achieved only stasis, not stability. Contra Fukuyama and directional history, Cowen asserts that this stability > stasis > discontinuous change implies a more cyclical historical mechanisms. That said, Cowen seems to be operating at a lower level of abstraction than Fukuyama, so they can theoretically both be right (so long as an ultimate global shift to Fascism isn't the discontinuous change); Cowen doesn't convincingly outline the mechanisms behind the energy supposedly leading to his discontinuous change, even if it feels likely correct given existing global challenges.

[**Brave New World**](https://www.amazon.ca/Brave-New-World-Aldous-Huxley/dp/030735654X/) <br>
_Aldous Huxley_ <br>
Authoritarianism through pleasure and strict social hierarchy. Game playing features prominently as pastime. Social strictures in place to inhibit independent thought: constant community / norms against solitude, no intra-class competition (e.g., free sharing of sexual partners), ready-made sleep-taught 'answers' for doubts in system, drugs (soma) as catch-all release valve. Commentators seem to focus on the themes of pleasure versus 'earned' achievement, but in the text it seems the stable social hierarchy is just as important to this universe (e.g., Bernard and Helmholtz become re-individualized through their perceived difference from their socially recognized status). The unravelling of John seems to be held up by Huxley, a self-described 'Pyrhonnic aesthete', to say "Are the values of Shakespeare / imbibed by our society really better than these Alphas?"
