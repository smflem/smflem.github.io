Similar to my [2015](https://smflem.github.io/2016/01/10/2015_media_diet.html) and [2016](https://smflem.github.io/2017/01/08/2016_media_diet.html) efforts, I’ve tracked the various movies, albums and books that I’ve enjoyed throughout last year. Works are listed below in the general order in which I read/watched them.

If you’re looking for specific recommendations, a few gems slightly off the beaten path are:

Book —Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey
Movie — Okja or The Host by Bong Joon Ho
Album — Love & Hate by Michael Kiwanuka

TL; DR — I read and watched a bunch of stuff last year. Looking for thoughtful recommendations for 2018.
