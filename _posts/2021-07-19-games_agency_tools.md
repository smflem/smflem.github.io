In the fall of 2020, I took up the computer game Factorio. While I had heard of this game before, it was the repeated mention of this game as interesting / useful by those in tech that pushed me over the edge into playing it (not least Tobi Luttke's / Shopify's appreciation of it [here](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/64592621/lutke-building-a-modern-business?tab=transcript).

While often testifying to how enjoyable or interesting the game was, these testimonials didn't really help me understand *why* a company like Shopify would reimburse it for employees. It wasn't immediately obvious that this was more than just a quirky tech perk.

So I played the game, a lot.

Reading C. Thi Nguyen's book *Games: Agency as Art* helped the underlying usefulness of Factorio snap into focus.

Nguyen's thesis is that games[^suitsian_games] are uniquely suited towards communicating forms of agency, and allowing agency-specific aesthetic experiences. It is because Factorio enables trasnferably-useful agentic modes in its players that corporations will foot the bill.

In Factorio, the player is crash-landed on an alien planet, seeking to collect and process resources through an increasingly elaborate factory in order to build and launch a spaceship (ostensibly to leave the planet, but play continues post-launch).

In this, there are at least 4 specific agential modes that a company like Shopify might seek to make available to its employees:

1. Bottleneck hunting

Megacorps and humble pin factories work in steps. Factorio pushes players to think of processes in terms of their individual steps to identify bottlenecks that are hampering production. By relieving the bottleneck, the system's throughput can be increased.

In Factorio, bottlenecks (and unbalanced systems more generally) are visually immediate[^bottleneck_analysis] in their manifestations. It's obvious when a process is backed up, or when a belt isn't full. This creates a low-friction / high engagement feedback loop for players to 1) identify the bottleneck, and 2) make adjustments to relieve it. And within the game mechanics, 'make adjustments' comprises a host of potential options, from natural balancing and buffers to just-in-time delivery and active control loops.

This allows players to build the muscle of looking for backed up systems, and deepen their sense of the possible solutions, all within the context of an enjoyable game.

2. Capacity planning

Though one may start the game lurching from bottleneck to bottleneck up the necessary tech tree, the more experienced player will seek to plan their next moves, with the mid and late stages of the game marked by the build-out necessary to supply the resource-intensive end-game products (e.g., science, modules)

In the game, if one builds a vast new expansion without proper planning, they'll almost certainly run dry of some key material or even cause a brownout across their factory.

These feedback mechanisms instill in the success-seeking player the need to plan ahead for the capacity and sequencing of any new undertaking, rather than just blindly charging ahead.

3. Technical debt

Factorio manages to make 'spaghetti code' nearly literal, with many new players finding their factory's expansion suffocated under a tangle of conveyor belts.

Processes planned for a previous stage of development (or without foresight to future needs) can't be expanded for lack of space. Even understanding how all the pieces fit together can be challenging, and refactoring becomes necessary. Changes might range from a simple reworking of inputs and outputs to deconstructing whole swathes of a factory in order to rework them to be more efficient.

In this, the games gives even non-technical players a chance to experience the pleasure of paying off technical debt without ever needing to know how to commit a line of code.

4. Refactoring / infrastructure design and deployment

In the late game, players have the opportunity to craft blueprints and to harness flying robots to help build their Brobdingnagian constructions. In this, the sub-processes themselves become items for manipulation and replication.

This allows for extensive refactoring of production flows, with the focus shifting to clearly delineated modules with structured inputs and outputs ( a la functions or APIs). For those players that progress to this stage, the incremental opportunities for reworking and controlling their factories can become enormous time sinks (not unlike the Second System Trap, though in this case many find it fun).

Taken together, for a certain type of player (and company) Factorio can be both enjoyable and valuable.

[^suitsian_games]: Nguyen bases his definition of games on that of Bernard Suits, while allowing that this definition does not encompass things like make-believe play that would still fit the thesis that games communicate agency. Suitsian games include computer games (like Factorio), along with diverse games like [xx and yy]

[^bottleneck_analysis]: Without a loss of specificity, identifying the bottleneck in a real-life corporate process can take weeks to months, if the necessary data exists at all.
